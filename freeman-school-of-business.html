            The A. B. Freeman School of Business is the business school of Tulane University, located in New Orleans, in the U.S. state of Louisiana. The school offers undergraduate programs, a full-time MBA program and other master's programs, a doctoral program, and executive education. It was a charter member of the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business in 1916. The school was named in honor of A. B. Freeman, a former chairman of the Louisiana Coca-Cola Bottling Co. and a prominent New Orleans philanthropist. The school is known in the finance community as the publisher of Burkenroad Reports. <br/><br/>The school's main location, in the center of Tulane's Uptown New Orleans campus, is across a pedestrian thoroughfare (McAlister Place) from the university's student center.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>In 1914, Tulane University's business school was founded as the College of Commerce and Business Administration. Two years later, the school became one of the fourteen founding members of the American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB), the nation's leading accrediting body for business schools. In 1940, the school began offering the Master of Business Administration program.
