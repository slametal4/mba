            William Douglas Parker (b. October 31, 1961) is an American businessman who is the chairman of American Airlines Group, the parent company of American Airlines. Parker previously served as chief executive officer of the airline from 2001 to 2023.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life and education ==<br/><br/>Parker grew up in Michigan and received a BA in Economics from Albion College (1984). He then received an MBA from the Owen Graduate School of Management at Vanderbilt University (1986), where American Airlines offered him a job after a campus interview.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early career ==<br/><br/>Parker was a financial analyst at American Airlines from 1986 to 1991, and a member of then CEO Robert Crandall's "Brat Pack", alongside Thomas W. Horton (former CEO President and Chairman of American), C. David Cush (former CEO of Virgin America), and Ben Baldanza (former CEO of Spirit Airlines).<br/><br/>Parker joined Northwest Airlines in 1991 and was tasked to help create a team that systematically figured out where the airline was making and losing money.  Tracking profits flight-by-flight in such detail at that level was a first for Northwest.<br/><br/>Parker became chief financial officer of America West Airlines in 1995 after returning to the United States, and because then-CEO Bill Franke wanted to train him to be a CEO, Parker moved around between finance, sales, and operations. Parker was named Chairman and CEO in September 2001, 10 days before the September 11 attacks.
