            Malta was to be represented at the Eurovision Song Contest 1973. The Maltese participating broadcaster, the Maltese Broadcasting Authority (MBA), was to select its entry through a national final. Deeming the quality level of the songs in the pre-selection for the national final to be too low, MBA opened a new submission period to find new songs. These new songs also didn't meet MBA's required level, so the broadcaster withdrew from the contest. Malta was drawn to perform in 6th place.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Before Eurovision ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Song for Europe 1973 ===<br/><br/>Song for Europe 1973 was the national final format developed by the Maltese Broadcasting Authority (MBA) which determined the song that would represent Malta at the Eurovision Song Contest 1973. The competition consisted of two parts, and was almost identical in format to their 1971 and 1972 national finals. The first part was the Malta Song Festival 1972, where the top 6 songs would then go on to the Song for Europe contest. The two contests were organised by two separate organisations; the Malta Song Festival was organised by the Malta Song Festival Board, while Song for Europe was organised by MBA. The use of Malta Song Festival as part of the Maltese national final was a cooperation between the two organisations, which lead to the broadcaster not actually being in control of the songs in its own national final. A new rule in Malta Song Festival gave MBA the right to decide after Malta Song Festival 1972, whether the songs are of high enough quality to be sent to the Eurovision Song Contest, and allowed them to withdraw their participation if they felt the song quality was too low.
