            Leaders for Global Operations (LGO) is a Dual Degree Engineering MBA program offered by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), sponsored by the MIT Sloan School of Management (MBA) and MIT School of Engineering (MS engineering).<br/><br/> MIT Leaders for Global Operations program ranks 1st in the U.S. News &amp; World Report for 2022's MBA programs in operations and production, 5th overall,  and 1st for best engineering school.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>MIT LGO began in 1988 as Leaders for Manufacturing (LFM) at a time when Japan and other overseas rivals were challenging U.S. manufacturing dominance in areas including the automotive industry. LGO students, who earn both an MBA form MIT Sloan and an SM from one of seven MIT School of Engineering program in two years, go on to become leaders in manufacturing and operations.<br/><br/>MIT LFM's founding directors were Thomas Magnanti, a former dean of the MIT School of Engineering and later the founding president of the Singapore University of Technology and Design; and H. Kent Bowen, an MIT faculty member in materials science and engineering and electrical engineering and computer science who is now the Bruce Rauner Professor of Business Administration, Emeritus at Harvard Business School.<br/><br/>In 2009, the program announced that it was changing its name from Leaders for Manufacturing to Leaders for Global Operations. The name change reflected the expansion from LFM’s historically broad understanding of manufacturing to encompass all aspects of operations. The change in name and mission allowed the program to address operations challenges beyond such traditional manufacturing sectors as automotive, aerospace, and high tech manufacturing, to include supply chain retailers such as Amazon and Inditex (Zara).<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Founding companies ===<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Program description ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Program timeline ===<br/><br/>LGO is a 24-month program with the incoming class conducting the LGO Summer Core semester June-August. The LGO Summer Core consists of classes on operations, statistics, probability, optimization, Python programming, and leadership.
