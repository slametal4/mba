            The John E. Anderson Graduate School of Management (branded as UCLA Anderson) is the graduate business school at the University of California, Los Angeles. The school offers MBA (full-time, part-time, executive), Post Graduate Program for Executives (PGPX), Financial Engineering, Business Analytics, and PhD degrees. It was named after American billionaire John E. Anderson in 1987, after he donated $15 million to the School of Management (the largest gift received from an individual by the University of California at the time).<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>The School of Management at UCLA was founded in 1935, and the MBA degree was authorized by the Regents of the University of California four years later.  In its early years, the school was primarily an undergraduate institution, although this began to change in the 1950s after the appointment of Neil H. Jacoby as dean; the last undergraduate degree was awarded in 1969. UCLA is rare among public universities in the United States for not offering undergraduate business administration degrees.  Undergraduate degrees in business economics are offered through the UCLA College of Letters and Science.<br/><br/>In 1950, the school was renamed the School of Business Administration. Five years later, it became the Graduate School of Business Administration; in the 1970s the school's name was changed again to the Graduate School of Management.<br/><br/>In 1987, John E. Anderson (1917–2011), class of 1940, donated $15 million to the school and prompted the construction of a new complex at the north end of UCLA's campus.
