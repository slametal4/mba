<h1>List of business schools in Europe</h1>
            
            This is a list of business schools in Europe. This list should not include schools that teach business alongside other subjects, i.e., a university that has a business curriculum should not be listed here as a business school.  Those schools that have articles (i.e., are notable) are accepted for inclusion without a supporting citation; those schools that do not have articles (i.e., red links) must have associated citations that reliably support the existence and focus of the school.<br/><br/>Triple accreditation in management education is the combined accreditation of the three major accreditation bodies: the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) based in the United States,  the  Association of MBAs (AMBA) based in the United Kingdom, and the EFMD Quality Improvement System (EQUIS) by the European Foundation for Management Development based in Belgium. More than 120 business schools worldwide, or about 1% of all business schools, are triple-accredited.<br/><br/>This list is sortable.
