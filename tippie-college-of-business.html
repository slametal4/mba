            The Tippie College of Business, also known as Tippie, is the business school located at the University of Iowa in Iowa City, Iowa. Established as the College of Commerce in 1921, Tippie is one of the oldest and highest-ranked business schools in the United States. The college is named after 1949 graduate Henry B. Tippie, marking the first academic division at the University of Iowa to be named after an alumnus. The college is located in the Pappajohn Business Building, which is named after 1952 graduate Des Moines venture capitalist John Pappajohn. Since 1923, the college has held the gold standard of accreditation, the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB). Today, with over 50,000 alumni and 4,700 students in programs spanning from BBAs to PhDs; the college houses six academic departments, 12 centers and institutes, and four student-managed endowment funds.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>Isaac Althaus Loos shaped the early beginnings of the college by establishing the School of Political and Social Science, which included degrees in commerce, economics and finance. In 1908, "Commerce" was added to the school name, which then featured nearly 40 courses. In 1921, the College of Commerce was born, enrolling approximately 100 students with 23 faculty members. Two years later, the college joined the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB).
