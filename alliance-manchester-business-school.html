            Alliance Manchester Business School (Alliance MBS) is the business school of the University of Manchester in Manchester, England. It is one of the oldest business schools in the UK, and provides education to undergraduates, postgraduates and executives.<br/><br/>According to the Financial Times 2018 Global MBA Rankings, its MBA programme is ranked 10th in Europe, 36th in the world and 4th in the UK. Its "MSc Business Analytics" programme ranked 6th in the world and 2nd in the UK; "MSc International Business and Management" 20th and "MSc Finance" 18th, as per the QS World University Ranking 2018.<br/><br/>It includes departments from both the former Victoria University of Manchester's Faculty of Business Administration, and from UMIST.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>The foundation of the School dates back to 1918, when the Manchester Municipal College of Technology (as UMIST was then called) pioneered academic training in management, with the formation of a Department of Industrial Administration funded by an endowment from asbestos magnate Sir Samuel Turner.<br/><br/>The London School of Economics and Manchester Municipal College of Technology were the first higher education institutions in the UK to follow the US trend of offering postgraduate management programmes in the 1930s. The Department of Industrial Administration was heavily influenced by management science pioneer Charles Garonne Renold.<br/><br/>The Robbins Report in the 1960s recommended that two national centres for postgraduate business education be created, and the Franks Report subsequently suggested that one would be in London centred on the University of London (this would become the London Business School), and one in Manchester centred on the (Victoria) University and UMIST. These became the first two University Grants Committee-funded business schools. The first director of the business school was appointed in 1965. Grigor McClelland was the first research fellow at Balliol College, Oxford in Management Studies, the chairman of the grocery chain Laws Stores and founder of the Journal of Management Studies. McClelland introduced the Manchester Experiment, which would become known as the Manchester Method.
