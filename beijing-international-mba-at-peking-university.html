            Beijing International MBA at Peking University or (BiMBA) (simplified Chinese: 北大国际; traditional Chinese: 北大國際; pinyin: Běidà Guójì) is both an internationally and nationally top-ranked graduate business school of Peking University in Beijing, China. It was founded in 1998 by Justin Yifu Lin as a collaboration between Peking University and a consortium of Jesuit universities, led by Fordham University in the United States. Vlerick Business School in Belgium joined BiMBA in 2008 and is currently the degree-granting university. BiMBA is operated by the National School of Development (NSD), formerly known as China Center for Economic Research at Peking University. The school offers a range of MBA programs from full-time, to part-time, and executive MBA programs.<br/><br/>Current Dean of BiMBA Mr. Yang Zhuang said in an article with the Chinese news website money.163.com that the value of BiMBA's education lies in its "internationalization". BiMBA has a very traditional Chinese atmosphere in terms of its building structures, however 30-40% of enrolled students in its full-time MBA program comes from abroad, and more than 80% has academic backgrounds from established foreign institutions. The diverse atmosphere coupled with a focus on smaller classes stimulates the students to reflect with one another and actively participate in class.<br/><br/>BiMBA's full-time MBA program is consistently ranked 2nd by Forbes magazine for China's Best business school, and its part-time program is ranked second, only behind Peking University's older Guanghua School of Management.
