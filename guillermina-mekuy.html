            Guillermina Mekuy Mba Obono (born 25 June 1982) is an Equatoguinean writer and politician who became a minister.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Life ==<br/><br/>Mekuy was born in 1982 in Evinayong and she spent six years in that country before she went to live in Madrid with her family as her father, who was a Guinean diplomat, had been given an assignment to Spain.<br/><br/>Her first novel, El llonto de la Perra, was published when she was seventeen. She graduated from the Autonomous University of Madrid in Law and Political Science. In 2008, her second novel, Las Tres Vírgenes de Santo Tomás (Three Souls for the Heart) was published. This erotic novel attracted some critical evaluation. The novel includes the subject of polygamy which Mekuy is opposed to - she says that she expects loyalty from her partner.<br/><br/>When she was 25 she accepted the position of head of her country's museums and libraries that was offered by the long serving President of Equatorial Guinea, Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo. In 2009 her country's national library, Biblioteca Nacional de Guinea Ecuatorial, opened and Mekuy was its first director. In 2010 the 34-minute film Teresa was released.
