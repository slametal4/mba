            The Robert J. Manning School of Business is the business school at the University of Massachusetts Lowell located in Lowell, Massachusetts. The Manning School is accredited by AACSB International (AACSB).<br/><br/>The school offers eight undergraduate majors along with MBA, MS, Ph.D., and graduate certificate programs. As of fall 2019, the school had 2,510 undergraduate students, and 1,529 graduate students, with 77 full-time faculty members.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>Introduced as the Division of Business and Economics in 1959 at Lowell Technological Institute, the Manning School of Business was originally designed to offer business classes to engineering students in the Industrial Technology program. The College of Management Science was developed in 1971 and offered a range of degree programs in business administration. The college was renamed the Manning School of Business in 2011 and is named after Robert J. Manning, the chairman and CEO of MFS Investment Management. The school was named after Manning, a 1984 graduate of UMass Lowell, after he and his wife donated $5 million to the university.<br/><br/>The Manning School of Business is housed in the Pulichino Tong Business Center, which opened in April 2017. The building is named after alumnus John Pulichino '67 and his wife, Joy Tong, who committed more than $4 million in scholarship funds for Manning School students.
