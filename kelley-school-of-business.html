            The Kelley School of Business (KSB) is an undergraduate and graduate business school for Indiana University Bloomington and Indiana University Indianapolis. As of 2022, approximately 13,538 full-time undergraduate and graduate students are enrolled on its Bloomington campus, as well as 1,596 students at the Indianapolis campus. In addition, more than 800 students study for graduate degrees through the school's online MBA and MS programs as part of "Kelley Direct". <br/><br/>As of 2025, Kelley School of Business has more than 133,000 alumni worldwide across 105 countries and five continents. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>The school was established as "School of Commerce and Finance" of Indiana University in 1920. It was subsequently renamed "School of Business Administration" in 1933 and "School of Business" in 1938. In 1997, it was named "Kelley School of Business" after its alumnus E.W. Kelley, chairman of the Steak 'n Shake Company, who had given a donation of $23 million.<br/><br/>Initially, it was housed in the Commerce Building constructed in 1923 (William A. Rawles Hall since 1971), moving to the Business and Economics Building in 1940 (called Woodburn Hall since 1971), and finally to today's Business School building in 1966.<br/><br/>Although classes had been held in Indianapolis since 1961, it wasn't until the fall of 1974 that the Kelley School of Business officially expanded to Indianapolis. It resides in the Business/Spea building on the IUI campus.
