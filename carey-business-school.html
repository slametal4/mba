            The Johns Hopkins Carey Business School (also Carey Business School or simply Carey) is the graduate business school of Johns Hopkins University, a private research university in Baltimore, Maryland. It was established in 2007 and offers full-time and part-time programs leading to the Master of Business Administration (MBA) and Master of Science (MS) degrees.<br/><br/>The business school is named after James Carey (1751-1834), a relative of Johns Hopkins. In 2006, sixth-generation descendant William P. Carey, through the W. P. Carey Foundation, donated $50 million to the Johns Hopkins University, contributing to the establishment of Carey Business School.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>In 2007, the School of Professional Studies in Business and Education at Johns Hopkins University was split into two new schools, the Carey Business School and the School of Education. As one of nine schools within Johns Hopkins, the School of Professional Studies had featured the majority of the university's part-time academic programs to serve the educational needs of working professionals.<br/><br/>The establishment of Carey Business School was engendered by the announcement in 2006 of a $50 million gift by philanthropist William P. Carey to Johns Hopkins through his W. P. Carey Foundation, in order to create a business school at the university. To date, this is the largest gift ever made to Johns Hopkins University in support of business education. The school is named after William P. Carey's ancestor, James Carey (1751-1834), a Baltimore shipper in the 18th and 19th centuries, chairman of the Bank of Maryland, a member of the Baltimore City Council, and a relative of university founder Johns Hopkins. W. P. Carey Foundation has similarly contributed to the endowments of the W. P. Carey School of Business at the Arizona State University ($50 million pledge in 2003), the University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law ($30 million donation in 2011), and the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School ($125 million gift in 2019).
