            Lancaster University Management School (LUMS) is the business school of Lancaster University in Lancaster, England. The school's history can be traced back to the establishment of departments of marketing and of operational research at the university's foundation in 1964. These and other related departments were organised into the "School of Business and Organizational Studies" in 1969. A full range of subjects are taught, ranging from undergraduate degrees to postgraduate degrees, including executive and full-time MBAs, PhDs and post-experience executive education.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>Lancaster University was founded in 1964, with departments including marketing and the first department of operational research in Europe. At that time, a deliberate decision was made not to establish a general business school in competition to those being set up in the wake of the Franks report in London and Manchester, and at other universities. However, within five years it was proposed to unify work in marketing, operational research, financial control, systems engineering, relevant parts of economics, computer science (then considered part of mathematics), and politics into a Lancaster Centre for Business Studies. After politics was removed from the plan and a new Department of Organizational Research created, this became a reality under the name of the School of Business and Organizational Studies in 1969. In 1974 the name of the school was changed to the School of Management and Organizational Science "to reflect more accurately the school's wide spread of interests in business, commerce, the trade unions and the public services".<br/><br/>The school remained an assembly of largely autonomous departments until Alan Mercer was appointed to a three-year term as chair in 1982.
