            The Joseph M. Katz Graduate School of Business is the graduate business school of the University of Pittsburgh located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Although business education had its origins at the university in 1907, the Graduate School of Business was established in 1960 from a merger of its predecessors, the School of Business Administration and the Graduate School of Retailing. It was renamed in 1987 after businessman and university alumnus benefactor Joseph Katz.  <br/><br/>The school offers a traditional, accelerated, part-time, business analytics, and executive Master of Business Administration (MBA) degrees as well as Master of Science degrees in Accounting, Business Analytics, Finance, Information Systems, Management, Marketing, Supply Chain Management and several Ph.D. programs in business. <br/><br/>Katz is part of Pitt Business, which refers to the collective capacity of Katz and the College of Business Administration (offers undergraduate business degrees), and five education and research centers.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Katz School tracings its beginnings to the introduction of business education to the university in 1907 as the Evening School of Economics, Accounts, and Finance. Classes met in the Fulton Building on Sixth Street in Pittsburgh. Three years later in 1910, the School of Economics (named for the London School of Economics) was formally set up on Pitt's Oakland campus. In 1916, the school became one of the 17 founding members of the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB).<br/><br/>By 1923 the school was renamed again, this time as the School of Business Administration.
