            The United Regional Basketball League (URBL) was a community-based amateur basketball league in the Philippines that played only one season in 2004. The league was managed by persons identified with the old Metropolitan Basketball Association (MBA), a professional community-based league that suspended operations in the middle of 2002. Basketball legend and former MBA commissioner Ramon Fernandez reprised his role with the URBL.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>Sometime in February 2004, the Ilocos Sur Snipers of Gov. Luis “Chavit” Singson and M. Lhuillier Kwarta Padala-Cebu City of Michel Lhuillier ceded from the National Basketball League (NBL), which had just been renamed the National Basketball Conference (NBC).  The two teams were not satisfied with the way the NBL/NBC was being managed and so opted to form their own league.<br/><br/>Three other teams later joined the fray – the Quezon Coco Huskers, Lactovitale-Cebu and Harbour Centre-Pampanga of Mikee Romero.<br/><br/>The opening ceremonies were held on September 25, 2004 at the New Cebu Coliseum. Forward Melchor Latoreno of the Huskers scored the first basket in league history in the opening game against Lactovitale. Lactovitale prevailed, 82-77, behind the 21 markers of Bonel Balingit.<br/><br/>Tournament format called for the five teams to play two round robins, with the top four advancing to the double round semifinals and their elimination round records set aside.
