            Bentley University is a private university in Waltham, Massachusetts, United States. It was founded in 1917 as a school of accounting and finance in Boston's Back Bay neighborhood. Bentley has one undergraduate school which offers 17 business majors and 14 arts and sciences majors, as well as 39 minors. Its graduate school offers five master's degrees, an MBA with eight disciplines, and three PhD programs.<br/><br/>While Bentley's main campus hosts almost all of its services, the university also has another campus one mile north. The North Campus hosts four residential buildings.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>Bentley University was founded in 1917 as the Bentley School of Accounting and Finance by Harry C. Bentley, who served as the school's president until 1953. In 1961, the college was accredited to confer four-year Bachelor of Science degrees under President Thomas Lincoln Morison, who moved the college from its Boylston Street address in Boston to its current-day location in Waltham, Massachusetts. Land for this move was purchased from the Lyman Estate in 1962, and the construction to develop the campus then lasted from 1963 to 1968.<br/><br/>Gregory H. Adamian, a major driving force in the college's development, became the fourth president in 1970.
