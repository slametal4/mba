            Jean Eyeghé Ndong (born 12 February 1946) is a Gabonese politician. He was the Prime Minister of Gabon from January 20, 2006 to July 17, 2009. He was also the First Vice-president of the Gabonese Democratic Party (PDG) until 2009.<br/><br/>Eyeghé Ndong resigned as Prime Minister in July 2009 and announced his intention to stand as an independent candidate in the August 2009 presidential election. Subsequently, he withdrew his candidacy in favor of a joint opposition candidate, André Mba Obame, and acted as spokesman for the opposition. He has been vice-president of the National Union, a unified opposition party, since its creation in February 2010.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Political career ==<br/><br/>Eyeghé Ndong, who was born in Libreville, is a nephew of Léon M'ba, who was President of Gabon from 1960 to 1967. He was administrative director of the National Social Security Fund (CNSS) from 1984 to 1990, then Deputy Director-General of the CNSS from 1990 to 1991 and Deputy Director-General of the National Social Guarantee Fund from 1991 to 1996.<br/><br/>In the December 1996 parliamentary election, Eyeghé Ndong won a seat in the National Assembly of Gabon as a PDG candidate in the second arrondissement of Libreville. He was then appointed to the government as Secretary of State under the Minister of Finance on 28 January 1997 and therefore did not sit in the National Assembly until 1999, when he was excluded from the first government of Prime Minister Jean-François Ntoutoume Emane.
