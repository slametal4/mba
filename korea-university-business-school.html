            Korea University Business School (KUBS; Korean: 고려대학교 경영대학; RR: Goryeo Daehakgyo Gyeongyeong Daehak) is the business school of Korea University in Seoul, South Korea. It was formed in 1946, becoming the first business school established in Korea. <br/><br/>The school offers an undergraduate program, full-time and part-time MBA programs, MS/PhD programs, as well as a few other non-degree programs. It received Korea's first accreditation from AACSB in 2005 and EQUIS in 2007, respectively.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>Korea University Business School was the first university department in Korea to introduce business studies. Founded in 1905 as part of Bosung College, the institution initially had two departments: Plutology (the study of wealth) and Law. Plutology later evolved into Commercial Science and subsequently into the modern business school at Korea University.<br/><br/>Korea University was the only university in Korea teaching business until 1917. In that year, Yonhi College, which is now Yonsei University, started its Commercial Science Department. KUBS was instrumental in bringing Western-style business education to Korea.
