            Andrew Tisch (born 1949) is an American businessman, who is the co-chair of Loews Corporation, the company founded by his father Laurence Tisch and uncle Preston Robert Tisch. <br/><br/>Together with his brother, James S. Tisch, and his first cousin, Jonathan Tisch, Andrew oversees a holding company involved in hotels, oil, and insurance.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life and education ==<br/><br/>Tisch was born in 1949, the son of Wilma "Billie" (née Stein) and Laurence A. Tisch. Both his parents were of Jewish descent. He has three brothers: James S. Tisch (born 1953), Daniel Tisch (father of David Tisch), and Thomas Jonah Tisch. <br/><br/>Tisch attended Suffield Academy in Suffield, Connecticut and then Cornell University, where he graduated in 1971 with a bachelor's degree. In 1977, he earned an MBA from Harvard University.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Career ==<br/><br/>Tisch worked for the family business, Loews Corporation, after school. He was president of Bulova from 1979 to 1989; and in 1990, he was named chairman and chief executive officer of Lorillard Tobacco Company where he was until 1995. Testifying under oath before the US Congress in 1994, Tisch said, "I believe that nicotine is not addictive," and when asked whether he knew that cigarettes caused cancer, Tisch answered under oath, "I do not believe that." After the death of his father in 2003 and uncle in 2005, responsibility for the family business was put in the hands of Tisch, his brother, James S. Tisch, who was CEO, and cousin, Jonathan Tisch, who oversees the company's hotel business.
