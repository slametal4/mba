            The Desautels Faculty of Management is a faculty of McGill University in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The faculty offers a range of undergraduate and graduate-level business programs, including the Bachelor of Commerce, Master of Business Administration and Doctor of Philosophy in management degrees. The Faculty of Management also offers a joint MBA/Law program with McGill's Faculty of Law.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>Officially founded in 1906 as the Department of Commerce within the Faculty of Arts, the Faculty of Management originated from a two-year commerce program. The Commerce program is named the School of Commerce, and the first Bachelor of Commerce (BCom) degrees are awarded by McGill in 1915. The McGill School of Commerce was founded in 1920, independent of the Faculty of Arts. The Graduate School of Business Administration was established in 1963 and graduated its first MBA class in 1965. The Graduate School of Business Administration was later merged with the School of Commerce in 1968 to form the Faculty of Management.<br/><br/>The Faculty of Management is located in the Samuel Bronfman Building which was named in honour of Samuel Bronfman for his donation of the building in 1972. The joint MBA/Law program received approval in 1978 and applications begin in 1979.
