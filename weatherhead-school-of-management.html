            The Weatherhead School of Management is a private business school of Case Western Reserve University located in Cleveland, Ohio. Weatherhead offers programs concentrated in sustainability, design innovation, healthcare, organizational behavior, global entrepreneurship, and executive education. The school is named for benefactor and Weatherchem owner Albert J. Weatherhead III, and its principal facility is the Peter B. Lewis Building.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>In 1952, Western Reserve University established the School of Business by combining the Cleveland College Division of Business Administration and the Graduate School Division of Business Administration. From its founding until 1988, the activities of the School of Business were divided among the number of buildings in downtown Cleveland and in University Circle. In 1967, the merger of Case Institute of Technology and Western Reserve University created Case Western Reserve University, and the Western Reserve University School of Business absorbed Case’s Division of Organizational Sciences to become the School of Management in 1970. In 1976, the school launched its first full-time MBA.<br/><br/>In 1980, the School of Management was renamed in honor of Albert J. Weatherhead, III, a Cleveland businessman and industrialist, following his $3 million gift to the school. In 1988, space on the Case Quad within what is now known as Nord Hall, then Enterprise Hall, was specially converted to house the growing Business Management program. This was made possible by funding from five leading Cleveland companies: Ohio Mattress, Nesco, Premier Industries, Parker Hannifin, and Keithley Industries.<br/><br/>In 2002, the new Peter B. Lewis Building was completed to house the management school.
