            Six of the eight Ivy League universities in the Northeastern United States have a business school that offers a Master of Business Administration degree, including Columbia University, Cornell University, Dartmouth College, Harvard University, the University of Pennsylvania, and Yale University. Wharton School at Pennsylvania and the Charles H. Dyson School of Applied Economics and Management at Cornell also have an undergraduate business program. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>Although the Ivy League is a college athletic conference, Ivy League also refers to eight private research universities in the Northeastern United States. Six of the eight Ivy League universities have a business school that offers a Master of Business Administration degree, including Columbia University, Cornell University, Dartmouth College, Harvard University, the University of Pennsylvania, and Yale University.<br/><br/>Cappelli, Bonet, and Hamori note, "The Ivy League business schools, associated with higher social class in terms of the income and social status of their students, had a long head start on other MBA programs." The creation of business schools at Ivy League universities occurred over a century ago. Joseph Wharton established the first university-based business school at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in 1881. In 1900, the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College was founded as the world's first graduate school of business. The Harvard Business School became the first business school to offer the MBA degree in 1921. Because there were no textbooks for its new MBA program, Harvard pioneered the case study method of teaching which is still used by business schools today.<br/><br/>In 1955, five Ivy League schools—Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth, Harvard, and Pennsylvania—offered MBA degrees.
