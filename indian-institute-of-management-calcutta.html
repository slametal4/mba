            Indian Institute of Management Calcutta (IIM Calcutta or IIM-C) is a public business school located in Joka, Kolkata, West Bengal, India. It was the first Indian Institute of Management to be established, and has been recognized as an Institute of National Importance by the Government of India in 2017. Programmes offered by IIM Calcutta include a two-year full-time MBA, a one-year full-time Post Graduate Diploma (PGPEX-VLM), a one-year full-time MBA for experienced executives (MBAEx), Doctor of Business Administration programme, a two-year full-time Post Graduate Diploma in Business Analytics, and a one-year full-time programme in Healthcare Management. IIM Calcutta is one of only four triple accredited business schools in India, and the first to get the recognition. It is also the only business school in India which is a part of the CEMS Global Alliance in Management Education.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>After India became independent in 1947, the Planning Commission was entrusted to oversee and direct the development of the nation. India proliferated in the 1950s, and in the late 1950s, the Commission started facing difficulties in finding suitable managers for the large number of public sector enterprises that were being established in India as a part of its industrial policy. To solve this problem, the Planning Commission in 1959 invited Professor George Robbins of the University of California to help in setting up an all India level institute of management studies. Based on his recommendations, the Indian government decided to set up two elite management institutes, named Indian Institutes of Management.<br/><br/>Indian Institute of Management Calcutta was the first of these IIMs, and was established in November 1961 in collaboration with the MIT Sloan School of Management, the government of West Bengal, the Ford Foundation and the Indian industry.
