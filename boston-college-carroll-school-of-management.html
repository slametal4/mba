            The Boston College Carroll School of Management (CSOM) is the business school of Boston College in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts.<br/><br/>Established in 1938, the Carroll School offers Bachelor of Science, Master of Business Administration (MBA), and Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degrees, in addition to Master of Science degrees in both finance and accounting, along with joint degree programs with Boston College's other schools.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>In 1938, the Carroll School was founded as the College of Business Administration. At the invitation of Boston College president Father William J. McGarry, S.J., more than 30 prominent businessmen and bankers from Boston and New York City provided counsel to the school as members of an advisory committee. Seventy-two student candidates were selected from over 100 applications to begin study. Classes began on September 16, 1938, in a building, which housed other graduate programs, at 126 Newbury Street in downtown Boston. The business school's enrollment was about 330 by the time 52 students first graduated in June 1942.<br/><br/>CSOM's home, Fulton Hall, is named for Father Robert Fulton, the first dean and twice president of Boston College. It was designed in the late 1940s in the collegiate gothic style by the Boston firm of Maginnis and Walsh. In addition to the James J. Byrnes Library, the building housed an industrial management laboratory in the basement that was considered innovative in the era of the "efficiency expert" and time-and-motion studies.
