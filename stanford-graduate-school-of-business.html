Willard Hotchkiss became the first dean of Stanford GSB.<br/><br/>The library was formally inaugurated on April 3, 1933. The collection was established with 1,000 volumes and assorted reports. The school moved from Jordan Hall to new quarters in the History Corner of the Main Quad in 1937.<br/><br/>Jonathan Levin was appointed as the 10th dean of the school in September 2016.
