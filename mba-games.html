            MBA Games is an annual competition amongst MBA (Master of Business Administration) programs in Canada. Schools compete for the Queen's Cup in academic, athletic and spirit events over one weekend at the beginning of January. All MBA schools in Canada are welcome to participate, but are not required to do so.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>The MBA Games began at Queen's University in 1988.  The Games were held at Queen’s for the first seven editions before being hosted by McGill in 1996 and the University of Western Ontario in 1997.   Every year since 1997, the Games have been hosted by various schools across the country. Generally, the winning school is given the honour of hosting the Games the following year. If the same school wins two years in a row, proposals from other schools are reviewed to determine the next host. The 2011 Games included 20 teams, the 2012 edition included 19 teams, and the 2013 edition included 22 teams (including Syracuse University from the US) making it the largest gathering ever of MBA students in Canada, which was close to 650 students.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Events ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Academics ===<br/><br/>Students compete in case competitions over the two days that are judged by a pre-selected panel of judges, typically professors and industry professionals.
