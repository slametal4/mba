            Smith School of Business (formerly Queen's School of Business) is a business school affiliated with Queen's University at Kingston. It is located at the university's Goodes Hall. Since July 2021, the school's dean has been Wanda Costen. <br/><br/>The School awards Bachelor of Commerce (BCom), Master of Business Administration (MBA), Executive MBA (EMBA), Accelerated MBA (AMBA), Master of Science in Management, (MSc) Master of Finance (MFin), Master of International Business (MIB), Master of Management Innovation and Entrepreneurship (MMIE), Master of Management in Artificial Intelligence (MMAI), Master of Management Analytics (MMA), Master of Digital Product Management (MDPM) and Ph.D. in Management degrees, as well as graduate diplomas in business (GDB)and accounting (GDA). The School also offers the Smith-Peking Double Degree in partnership with the Guanghua School of Management at Peking University and the Executive MBA Americas in partnership with the Samuel Curtis Johnson Graduate School of Management at Cornell University.<br/><br/>Smith School of Business is fully accredited by the AACSB (United States) and the EFMD (EQUIS) (Europe).<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Naming ==<br/><br/>On October 1, 2015, the Queen's School of Business was renamed the Stephen J.R. Smith School of Business in recognition of a $50-million donation from Stephen J. R. Smith, a graduate of the Queen's University's Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science. The donation is the largest gift ever made to a Canadian business school, growing the school's endowment from $54 million to $104 million.  As of 2015, this will result in Smith being a close second in total endowment among Canadian business schools, next to only the Rotman School of Management.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>Queen's University launched its undergraduate business program in 1919, making it the oldest Bachelor of Commerce in Canada.
