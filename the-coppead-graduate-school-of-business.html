The idea was conceived by a group of professors from the Production Engineering Program (Coppe/UFRJ), and as the result of a project to create a business school in Brazil.<br/><br/>During the first formative years, there was a considerable exchange of faculty with some of the international business schools in the United States and Europe.<br/><br/>In 1980, COPPEAD moved to its own building within the main UFRJ campus and, soon later, acquired the status of an autonomous institute within the structure of the university, thus becoming the COPPEAD Graduate School of Business.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Campus ==<br/><br/>The COPPEAD campus is located within Ilha do Fundão at Cidade Universitária Campus of Federal University of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Accreditations, associations and initiatives ==<br/><br/>COPPEAD has been accredited by the European Quality Improvement System (EQUIS) since 2006.
