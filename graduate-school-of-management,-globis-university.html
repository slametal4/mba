            Graduate School of Management, Globis University (Japanese: グロービス経営大学院大学, Hepburn: gurōbisu keiei daigakuin daigaku, English: , commonly referred to and stylized as GLOBIS University) is a graduate business school with campuses in Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya, Fukuoka, Sendai, Yokohama, and Mito in Japan and Singapore, Bangkok, San Francisco, and Brussels internationally. Globis University started as a private education venture, Globis Management School, in 1992 by Japanese entrepreneur Yoshito Hori, later gaining official university status in 2006. Globis University is Japan's largest graduate business school, with an annual intake of 1,100 MBA students and total enrolment of 2,525 students in 2024. <br/><br/>The university offers part-time and online MBA degree programs in English or Japanese and a full-time degree MBA program in English.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== GLOBIS Management School ===<br/><br/>Globis Management School was established as a private, non-accredited business school in Tokyo by Globis Corporation and its founder Yoshito Hori in 1992. It would form the basis for the later establishment of Graduate School of Management, Globis University. Hori, while doing his MBA at Harvard Business School from 1989 until 1991, observed that entrepreneurs in the US had access to a business environment highly conducive to start-ups. Aiming to nurture a similar environment in Japan, he set out to create a business centered around an ecosystem of knowledge, people and capital.<br/><br/>Hori had initially approached his alma mater regarding opening a franchise in Japan but was turned down, leading to the establishment of an independent business school. A licensing agreement was made, however, allowing Harvard case studies to be used at GLOBIS Management School.
