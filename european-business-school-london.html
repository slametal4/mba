            European Business School London (EBS London) was a private Business School in Regent's Park in Central London. It was a constituent school of Regent's College London, which became Regent's University London in 2013..<br/><br/>EBS London offered courses in the field of International Business Management and had a strong focus on Banking and Finance, reflected by the fact that a third of its graduates pursued a career in that field. Besides its focus on teaching, the university had a long-standing commitment to research, offering MPhil and PhD degrees.<br/><br/>Around 900 students from over 85 nationalities made the School highly international. It also had as strong focus on languages, with 70% of its graduates being fluent in at least four languages.<br/><br/>EBS has a strong representation of all nations especially Russian, Spanish, Italian and French.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>Founded in 1979, European Business School was an international institution with campuses in London, Paris, Frankfurt (Oestrich-Winkel) and Milan which had a pioneering influence on the European model of education. In 1985, though still co-operating and exchanging students, the EBS schools became independent. Each school kept the EBS name but added the city name after.
