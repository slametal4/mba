            Berlin School of Business and Innovation (BSBI) is a business school run by private, for-profit education company Global University Systems in Berlin, Germany. The university launched in 2017 and began instructing students in 2018.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>Berlin School of Business and Innovation was founded in 2017 by Global University Systems (GUS), a for-profit education company. According to the Berlin Senate, "The Berlin School of Business and Innovation (BSBI) is a franchise institution operated by Global University Systems (GUS), which was reported in 2017 in accordance with §124a BerlHG in the state of Berlin."<br/><br/>In 2018, after an MBA Journal article reported that BSBI's admission requirements were extremely low, BSBI's parent company Global University Systems’ chief academic officer Maurits van Rooijen defended BSBI, stating that lower tuition made the school more accessible to more students.<br/><br/>In November 2018, BSBI appointed Prince Paul of Romania and Princess Lia of Romania as the school's Patrons, and Princess Madeleine of Bentheim and Steinfurt as Honorary Patron.<br/><br/>In 2019, various media publications reported that students were unhappy with the school's facilities and quality of education, and the students had written complaints to school administrators. In response to student complaints, the Berlin Senate temporarily suspended BSBI's Italian partner's visa issuance rights, launched an investigation and asked the school to improve its programs. The suspension was lifted when the school agreed to implement and report on the requested improvements.<br/><br/>In November 2019, BSBI announced that it had partnered with Concordia University Chicago to deliver programmes at its Berlin campus.<br/><br/>In June 2020, BSBI became an official signatory of the United Nations Principles for Responsible Management Education (UN-PRME) initiative.
