            The University of Sydney Business School is the business school and a constituent body of the University of Sydney. It was established in January 2011 and formed from the School of Business within the previous Faculty of Economics and Business. The former combined faculty itself descended from the original Faculty of Economics founded in 1920, which was the first faculty of its kind in Australia.<br/><br/>The School is the first in Australia to receive accreditation by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) and the European Quality Improvement System (EQUIS) from the European Foundation for Management Development. The School was awarded AMBA accreditation in December 2019 and thus joined the prestigious global club of Triple Accredited business schools. It is also the only Australian business school to become an associate member of the Global Alliance in Management Education (CEMS).<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>Established in 1920, the Faculty of Economics initially offered the Bachelor of Economics degree which commenced in 1914. The postgraduate Master of Economics degree commenced in 1925. In 1985, the faculty introduced its second undergraduate and postgraduate degree programs, the Bachelor of Economic and Social Sciences and the Master of Economic and Social Sciences, respectively. In 1993 its third undergraduate degree program, the Bachelor of Commerce, was introduced.
