            The D'Amore-McKim School of Business is the business school of Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts. The business program was founded in 1922, followed by the Graduate School of Business Administration in 1952.<br/><br/>Northeastern University's cooperative education program, which allows students to alternative semesters of study and full-time professional experience, works with more than 3,500 employers in nearly 50 countries around the world.<br/><br/>The D'Amore-McKim School has more than 50,000 living alumni, including graduates from both the graduate and undergraduate programs, in 137 countries globally.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>The D'Amore-McKim School of Business can trace its history back to the earliest days of Northeastern's existence, when commerce and industry courses were offered in 1907 by the School of Commerce and Finance of the Boston Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA). The fundamental aim of the school was to provide students with courses in commerce, accounting and finance in preparation for business positions. During that first year, 25 courses were offered, 18 instructors were hired and 208 students enrolled. Through evening study, B.C.S. and M.C.S degrees were eventually offered. After years of consideration, a School of Business Administration opened in September 1922, offering courses in general business, industrial management, marketing, finance and accounting. The first two years of the four-year program were devoted to learning sound business principles and the last two years were dedicated to specialization leading to definite marketable skills.
