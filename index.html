            The Zicklin School of Business (commonly known as Zicklin) is the business school of Baruch College. It was established in 1919 and is named after financier and alumnus Lawrence Zicklin. Zicklin is the largest business school in the United States, with more than 10,000 students enrolled in its programs. Zicklin and the Murray Koppelman School of Business at Brooklyn College are the only two units of the City University of New York that are accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB).<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>In 1919, the City College of New York established a School of Business and Civic Administration, offering its first MBA program one year later. The school was renamed in 1953 in honor of Bernard M. Baruch, a noted statesman and financier who was instrumental in the school's formation. In 1968, after the addition of arts and sciences departments and degree programs, Baruch College became a senior college within the CUNY system.<br/><br/>In 1998, Baruch College's business school was renamed the Zicklin School of Business, in recognition of an $18 million donation by Lawrence and Carol Zicklin. Later, Zicklin made an additional $2 million donation to endow Baruch College’s Center for Financial Integrity. Lawrence Zicklin was a former chairman of the board of investment management firm Neuberger Berman.
