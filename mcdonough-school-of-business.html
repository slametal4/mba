            The Robert Emmett McDonough School of Business, commonly shorted to the McDonough School of Business and abbreviated as the MSB, is the business school of Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. Founded in 1957, it grants both undergraduate and graduate degrees, and is one of the university's nine constituent schools. Since 1998, the school has been named in honor of Georgetown alumnus Robert Emmett McDonough.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>The school was founded in 1957 as an outgrowth of the School of Foreign Service, and was originally named the Georgetown University School of Business Administration. In 1993, the name was changed to the Georgetown University School of Business. On October 7, 1998, the School of Business was renamed the Robert Emmett McDonough School of Business in honor of alumnus Robert Emmett McDonough (a 1949 graduate of the School of Foreign Service) in honor of his $30 million donation to the school.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Key Dates ===<br/><br/>Founding dates for academic programs: <br/><br/><br/><br/>Undergraduate Program (B.S. in Business Administration): 1957<br/><br/>Full-time MBA Program: 1981<br/><br/>Executive Education: 1988<br/><br/>Executive MBA: 1994<br/><br/>Flex MBA: 2005<br/><br/>Executive Master’s in Leadership: 2005<br/><br/>M.S. in Finance: 2014<br/><br/>M.A. in International Business and Policy: 2017<br/><br/>M.S. in Management (MiM): 2019<br/><br/>B.S. in Business and Global Affairs (BGA): 2020<br/><br/>M.S. in Business Analytics: 2021<br/><br/>M.S. in Environment &amp; Sustainability Management: 2022<br/><br/>B.S. in International Business, Language, and Culture (IBLC): 2023<br/><br/>M.S. in Global Real Assets: 2023<br/><br/>Executive MBA Dubai: 2023<br/><br/>Founding dates for faculty-led centers, initiatives, and institutes: <br/><br/><br/><br/>Center for Business and Public Policy: 2002<br/><br/>Georgetown Women’s Leadership Institute: 2003<br/><br/>Georgetown Entrepreneurship: 2009<br/><br/>Center for Financial Markets and Policy: 2010<br/><br/>Steers Center for Global Real Estate: 2010<br/><br/>Business for Impact: 2011<br/><br/>Georgetown Institute for Consumer Research: 2012<br/><br/>Georgetown Institute for the Study of Markets and Ethics: 2012<br/><br/>Global Business Initiative: 2012<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== The Rafik B.

Hariri Building, named after the late Rafik Hariri, former Prime Minister of Lebanon and father of Georgetown alumnus Saad Hariri, also a former Prime Minister of Lebanon. The $82.5-million privately funded building opened in the summer of 2009 and is LEED Silver certified. The new building includes 15 classrooms, eight case-style rooms, five tiered lecture rooms, and two flat-floor rooms; 34 breakout rooms complete with data ports, flat-screen video monitors, and white boards; separate undergraduate and graduate commons areas and lockers for graduate students; 120 faculty offices; 11 interview rooms within the Career Management Office; 15 conference rooms throughout the building; and a 400-seat auditorium, among other features.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Academics ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>Several academic themes distinguish the McDonough School of Business and give the school a special identity among managers and academicians, including international and intercultural dimensions of the marketplace, the importance of written and oral communication, and interpersonal effectiveness in organizations. As a Catholic and Jesuit university, Georgetown stresses ethics and social justice in its curriculum.
