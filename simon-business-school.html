            Simon Business School (formerly known as the William E. Simon Graduate School of Business Administration) is the business school of the University of Rochester. It is located on the university's River Campus in Rochester, New York. It was renamed in 1986 after William E. Simon (1927–2000), the 63rd United States Secretary of the Treasury. The school's current dean is Sevin Yeltekin.<br/><br/>Simon Business School offers full-time, part-time, and executive Master of Business Administration (MBA) programs (based in either Rochester or Switzerland), as well as Master of Science (MS) and Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) programs.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>The University of Rochester started as a small business program in 1958, and awarded its first MBA degree in 1962, but the School's impact in the business world can be traced to a later decision by then University President W. Allen Wallis to create a first-class business school in Rochester. In 1964, he was recruited as dean. <br/><br/>William H. Meckling - who would remain dean for 19 years - was a noted economist known for his analysis and leadership in support of an all-volunteer U.S. armed service. As dean, he committed the school to an economics-based approach to problem solving, recruited a faculty for researches at school, initiated new finance and accounting journals that incorporated economics, eliminated boundaries between functional departments, and transformed what had been a small, undergraduate and evening business school into a graduate business program.<br/><br/>As a result of work by Meckling and Michael C. Jensen - one of the faculty members he recruited - and other faculty members, the school became known for its contributions to the areas of finance, accounting, and organizational theory.
