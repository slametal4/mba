            The Tepper School of Business is the business school of Carnegie Mellon University. It is located in the university's 140-acre (0.57 km2) campus in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.<br/><br/>The school offers degrees from the undergraduate through doctoral levels, in addition to executive education programs.<br/><br/>The Tepper School of Business, originally known as the Graduate School of Industrial Administration (GSIA), was founded in 1949 by William Larimer Mellon. In March 2004, the school received a record $55 million gift from alumnus David Tepper and was renamed the David A. Tepper School of Business.<br/><br/>Numerous Nobel Prize-winning economists have been affiliated with the school, including alumni Dale T. Mortensen, Oliver Williamson, Edward Prescott, Finn Kydland and faculty members Herbert A. Simon, Franco Modigliani, Merton Miller, Robert Lucas, and Lars Peter Hansen.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>In 1946, economist George Leland Bach was hired by the Carnegie Institute of Technology (predecessor of Carnegie Mellon University) to restart the school's economics department. Bach had previously been working at the Federal Reserve during World War II. He added William W. Cooper from the field of Operations Research (which had increased its visibility during the war) and Herbert A. Simon, a political scientist who was to direct the undergraduate business program. The beginnings of the Cold War were applying pressure on the academic community to increase US managerial ability, and when William Larimer Mellon gave a $6 million grant to found a school of industrial administration, Bach became the first dean, bringing along the entire economics department.<br/><br/>Under Bach's leadership, in 1958, the school's Management Game was the first to use computer simulations for experiential learning of business roles; such simulations have subsequently been adopted by other institutions.
