            The Isenberg School of Management is the business school and also the second largest school at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, the flagship campus for the University of Massachusetts system.  The Isenberg School is accredited by the AACSB International and ACPHA.<br/><br/>The school offers seven undergraduate majors along with MS, MBA and Ph.D. programs. As of the 2014-2015 academic year, there were approximately 3500 undergraduate students and 1300 graduate students enrolled in the Isenberg School of Management. As of 2017, the Isenberg School has nearly 44,000 alumni in 72 countries.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>Business courses were first offered at the Massachusetts Agricultural College in the early years of the 20th century, expanding rapidly during the 1930s and 1940s in response to student demand. The college's board of trustees established the School of Business Administration in 1947, and within seven years, it was conferring graduate degrees, including doctorates after 1967.<br/><br/>In 1964, the school moved to its current building in the heart of the UMass Amherst campus. In 1983, the School of Business Administration changed its name to School of Management. In 1998 the Isenberg School of Management was named after Eugene Isenberg, the chairman and CEO of Nabors Industries, which at the time was a world leader in gas and petroleum drilling.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== McCormack Department of Sport Management ===<br/><br/>In 2010, the department of sports studies was renamed as the McCormack Department of Sport Management after Mark McCormack, founder and CEO of IMG. The McCormack family gifted $1.5 million to endow educational initiatives including the Executive-in-Residence program and an international travel and exchange program.
