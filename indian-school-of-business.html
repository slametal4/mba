            The Indian School of Business (ISB) is a private business school with campuses in Hyderabad and Mohali, India. It offers certificates in various post-graduate management programs.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>The Indian School of Business (ISB) was started in 1996 by a bunch of businessmen and academics. Co-founders Rajat Gupta and Anil Kumar, senior executives of McKinsey &amp; Company, directed teams of McKinsey consultants to start the school. Gupta recruited U.S. business leaders while Kumar recruited Indian leaders for its executive board. Formal partnerships were established with international business schools Wharton and Kellogg. Pramath Sinha, then a junior partner at McKinsey in India, was persuaded to take a leave of absence to be the school's first dean. Rajat Gupta became the school's first chairman and was succeeded by Adi Godrej in 2011. The then Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh Sri N. Chandrababu Naidu played an important role for establishment of ISB in Hyderabad. The foundation stone for the campus was laid in 1999 and was inaugurated by Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in 2001.
