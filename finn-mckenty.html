            Finnegan "Finn" McKenty (born September 7, 1978) is an American marketing strategist, music commentator, writer and graphic designer who is director of marketing at the online education platform URM Academy. Previously, he  ran the YouTube channel The Punk Rock MBA, was executive producer at CreativeLive's "Music &amp; Audio" channel and, under the persona Sergeant D, wrote articles in MetalSucks and Stuff You Will Hate. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life ==<br/><br/>Finn McKenty grew up in Snohomish, Washington. He started going to hardcore punk shows in December 1990 and began making zines in 1992 in order to talk about bands which "deserved more attention", according to him. His fanzines received positive reviews from Maximumrocknroll, Punk Planet and HeartattaCk, which praised their interviews with underground powerviolence and grindcore bands, photographs and graffiti art. At eighteen he relocated to Cleveland, Ohio. McKenty studied at the University of Cincinnati.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Career ==<br/><br/>After graduating, McKenty did strategic design at a product development consulting firm and worked for several companies, including Swiffer and Febreze. He also created videos for Quiksilver, DC Shoes, among other brands in the sports publication Flo. Around 2009, he went on to Abercrombie &amp; Fitch where he worked in product design, at some point supervising factories in Asia, and then continued as their marketing production coordinator for several years.
