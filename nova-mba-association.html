            NOVA-MBA Association is a nonprofit organization established in 2001 by students from Ivy-League schools with the support of top Italians abroad including Nobel Prize Franco Modigliani and other prominent academic and business leaders. The association is focused on promoting higher education, meritocracy, management culture as well as actively organizing ways to engage both MBA students as well as alumni into a cohesive and engaged network. <br/><br/>The organization's mission is to "Facilitate the participation of Italian Talents to top MBA programs, contribute to the success of Italy and Italian Companies by promoting Italian MBA students and alumni recruiting, and create a strong, lasting and highly valuable network of successful executives, entrepreneurs and professionals among Italian MBA students and alumni".<br/><br/>Since 2022 it's part of NOVA Foundation together with Mentors4u, the largest european mentoring program.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Membership ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Member schools ===<br/><br/>NOVA membership has historically been restricted to Italian MBA graduates of the seventeen US institutions included in the list below.  <br/><br/>As of 2024, prestigious European institutions, such as INSEAD and London Business School, have been included as members.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, graduates of other programs figuring in the list of United States graduate business school rankings, and most notably the Yale School of Management, the Ross School of Business, and the Darden Graduate School of Business Administration are generally accepted as well.<br/><br/>Note that all six Ivy League business schools are included (Wharton, Tuck, HBS, CBS, Cornell, Yale). Brown University and Princeton University do not have business schools (although Brown offers a joint Executive MBA program with Spain's Instituto de Empresa Business School).<br/><br/>As of 2012, the association is in the process of evaluating extending membership to graduates of Top European MBAs as well (such as INSEAD, IMD and others).
