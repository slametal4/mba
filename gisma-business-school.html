            Gisma University of Applied Sciences is a privately owned University in Germany with its main site in Potsdam and a branch in Berlin. It was launched in September 1999 as a joint initiative by the German state of Lower Saxony and several large private-sector companies that were based there. In financial difficulty after its partnership with Krannert School of Management ended, GISMA was rescued from bankruptcy when it was bought by the for-profit education company  Global University Systems in September 2013.<br/><br/>As of 2021 it offers a variety of undergraduate and postgraduate degrees, including an AMBA Accredited Global MBA, all of which are awarded by Gisma University of Applied Sciences. In 2024, Gisma University of Applied Sciences announced its partnership with Kingston University London, with which it now offers double degrees awarded by both institutions.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Foundation and early years ===<br/><br/>GISMA was established by the state of Lower Saxony as a private non-profit foundation in 1998 and opened in Potsdam in September 1999. Among those behind the initiative were former Federal Chancellor Gerhard Schröder and several large German companies, including Continental AG, Volkswagen AG, and the steel industry conglomerate  Georgsmarienhütte Holding GmbH, all of which are based in Lower Saxony. The companies supported the school by making annual donations and sending their employees to its MBA programmes. From the outset GISMA formed a partnership agreement whereby it would pay Krannert School of Management in the United States to deliver and award the MBAs. Krannert's students also had the option of studying for their MBAs at the GISMA site in Potsdam.
