            Henley Business School, Africa (formerly Henley Management College, South Africa), in the Paulshof suburb of Johannesburg, is a branch of the British-based Henley Business School, part of the University of Reading and one of the oldest business schools in Europe with operations in 17 countries across the globe. The African institution, which is locally accredited and has offered the MBA in South Africa since 1992, shares international accreditation with its parent school and is also locally accredited in South Africa.  The South African campus has offered the MBA in South Africa since 1992.  In 2002, the South African location became a fully owned subsidiary of its British parent. As the operation in South Africa is the only Henley Business School on the African continent, it has students living in neighbouring countries studying and being supported through this office. Henley Africa has two South African campuses, one in the Paulshof suburb of Johannesburg, and the other in Woodstock, Cape Town, and services students living in South Africa and neighbouring countries.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History and growth in Africa ==<br/><br/>In 1992 Henley Business School introduced its MBA to the South African market, under license to the Graduate Institute of Management Technology (GIMT) and the first 18 MBA students graduated in 1995. When GIMT was sold, Henley UK bought back the license, the South African operation became a branch office and, in 2002, launched itself as a fully integrated school of Henley in South Africa. In 2008 Henley Management College merged with the University of Reading to form Henley Business School, one of the world’s largest full-service business schools.<br/><br/>In 2007, Henley established its social entrepreneurship arm.
