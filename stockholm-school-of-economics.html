            The Stockholm School of Economics (SSE; Swedish: Handelshögskolan i Stockholm, HHS) is a private business school located in city district Vasastaden in the central part of Stockholm, Sweden. SSE offers BSc, MSc and MBA programs, along with PhD- and Executive education programs.<br/><br/>SSE is accredited by EQUIS and is a member of CEMS. SSE has founded sister organizations: SSE Riga in Riga, Latvia, and SSE Russia in St Petersburg and Moscow, Russia. It also operates the European Institute of Japanese Studies (Japanese, kanji: 欧州日本研究所, Japanese, romaji: Ōshū Nihon kenkyūjo), a research institute in Tokyo, Japan.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>The banker Knut Agathon Wallenberg donated 100 000 SEK in 1903 (Equivalent to around  7 million SEK in 2023) to lobby for founding a business school in Stockholm. Wallenberg considered that "It was important to raise the social status of the merchant class". Lobbying was necessary because the classical tradition in western thought has a long-standing disdain for commerce, dating back to the ancient Greeks. This disdain was also evident during the Middle Ages, when trade was considered equivalent to theft and seen as a dirty and vulgar occupation. During this time, merchants were known in swedish as: Krämare, from the greek chrema (money), were socially scorned, even by the upper class, and were perceived as unproductive individuals solely interested in "making money.". <br/><br/>Continuing the lobbying the Wallenberg family also financed a study trip where the doctor in philosophy Helmer Keys set out to travel through Europe to collect data that could motivate the decision to establish a business school.
