            The Aarhus University School of Business and Social Sciences (in short Aarhus BSS) is one of four faculties of Aarhus University in Denmark. The school consists of seven departments: Economics and Business Economics, Management, Political Science, Law, Business Communication, Psychology and Behavioural Sciences and Department of Business Development and Technology (located in the city of Herning). The main campus is located in Aarhus.<br/><br/>Aarhus BSS is a merger from 2007 and teaches programmes at Bachelor's, Master and PhD level along with the MBA (Master of Business Administration), EMBA (Executive MBA) programmes and Summer University and Winter school courses. In 2010 Dale T. Mortensen, a Niels Bohr Visiting professor at Aarhus University, received the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences together with his colleagues Peter Diamond and Christopher Pissarides.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>The history of the Aarhus BSS is both old and new. On 1 January 2007, Aarhus School of Business (Danish: Handelshøjskolen; ASB) merged into Aarhus University. In 2011, the Aarhus School of Business and the Faculty of Social Sciences at Aarhus University were merged under the name of Aarhus University, School of Business and Social Sciences. Aarhus School of Business had been founded in 1939, and the Faculty of Social Sciences consisted of several departments and faculties established between 1936 and 1969. The 2011 merger made Aarhus BSS one of the largest business schools in Europe.
