            The Shreyans Prasad Jain Institute of Management and Research (SPJIMR) is a private non-profit post-graduate management school based in Mumbai, India. Founded in 1981 under the aegis of Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, The institute offers several full-time and part-time management programmes.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>In 1981, SPJIMR was inaugurated by the British prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, as the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan's  Institute for Master of Management Studies. The first batch joined the institute for the Master of Management Studies, or MMS programme. The class of 1983 was placed in several top companies, including BPCL, HDFC Ltd., Johnson &amp; Johnson, Wipro, Asian Paints, Nerolac Paints Ltd, and Godrej &amp; Boyce. In 1986, Dr. M.L. Shrikant joined the institute as the dean and led the institution for almost three decades, introducing new methods of teaching and imparting management education<br/><br/>In 1992, SPJIMR acquired an autonomous status. The MMS programme was then renamed as PGDM.<br/><br/>In 1994 and 1995, Development of Corporate Citizenship (DoCC)  and ADMAP (Assessment and Development of Managerial and Administrative Potential)  were launched respectively. PGDM students work with non-profit organisations in rural India for six weeks as part of DoCC. Students from PGDM work in committees as part of ADMAP. This helps develop skills to enhance their managerial potential.<br/><br/>In 2000, autumn internships were started for the PGDM students after they completed their specialisation phase.
