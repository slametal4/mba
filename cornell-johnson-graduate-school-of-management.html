            The Cornell Johnson Graduate School of Management is a graduate business school of Cornell University, a private university in Ithaca, New York.   <br/><br/>Founded in 1946, the school was renamed in 1984 to honor Samuel Curtis Johnson, founder of S.C. Johnson &amp; Son, following a landmark $20 million endowment from his family which was the largest gift ever made to a business school at the time. In 2017, Herbert Fisk Johnson III of S. C. Johnson &amp; Son donated $150 million to the school and the newly established Cornell SC Johnson College of Business, resulting in the college's renaming.   <br/><br/>Graduates of the Cornell SC Johnson College of Business earn some of the highest salaries of MBA programs in the United States. MBA graduates of Johnson earned an average first-year compensation of $175,000, including a bonus of $38,826, with 77.9% reporting a sign-on bonus, ranking as the second-highest total compensation among all U.S.-based MBA programs. With an acceptance rate of 29.9 percent, the Johnson Graduate School of Management is the seventh most selective business school in the United States.<br/><br/>The Johnson School is housed in Sage Hall and supports more than 80 full-time faculty members. There are 600 students in the full-time, two-year MBA Master of Business Administration (MBA) program in Ithaca, and around 40 Ph.D students, all advised by Johnson faculty. The Johnson School is known for its rural setting and small class size — with close proximity to New York City. As such, both factors, combined with Johnson's commitment to the two-year MBA program in Ithaca and one-year MBA at Cornell Tech, contribute to its high giving rate of 1 in 4 among the 13,000 global Johnson alumni.
