            The Martin J. Whitman School of Management is the business school of Syracuse University in Syracuse, New York. Named after Martin J. Whitman, an alumnus and benefactor of the school, the school was established in 1919. The Whitman School offers bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees, as well as executive degree programs.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>The school was established at Syracuse University in 1919 as the College of Business Administration. By 1920, the school was the 16th school in the United States to receive accreditation from Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB). The first Supply Chain Management program in the United States began at Whitman in 1919. In 1948, the MBA program was established as the Army Comptrollership Program; the Army Comptrollership Program was established in 1952; and the doctoral program was created in 1965. The Whitman school has been a leader in education innovation and began offering a distance MBA in 1977.<br/><br/>After a major donation from 1949 graduate Martin J. Whitman, founder of Third Avenue Management, and Lois Whitman in June 2003, a new 160,000-square-foot state-of-the-art building was constructed and the university renamed the School of Management after him.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Student Profile ==<br/><br/>40% of the students in Whitman's full-time MBA program for the Class of 2022 are women.
