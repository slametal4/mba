            ESCP Business School (French: École Supérieure de Commerce de Paris; English: Upper Business School of Paris) is a French business school and grande école founded in Paris and based across Europe with campuses in Paris, Berlin, London, Madrid, Turin, and Warsaw. Established in 1819, it is considered the world's oldest business school. ESCP Business School runs BSc, MBA, Executive MBA, master's degree programs in finance and management, executive education programs,  and PhD programs.<br/><br/>It is, along with HEC and ESSEC, a member of the Parisiennes, an informal term designating the three most prestigious business schools in France.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>The school was established in Paris on 1 December 1819 by two former Napoleonic soldiers, Germain Legret and Amédée Brodart. Germain Legret had founded two business schools in Paris in 1815 and 1818, but both closed their doors rapidly. ESCP offered entrepreneurship education in the 1820s. It was modelled on the first grande école, the École Polytechnique, founded by Lazare Carnot and Gaspard Monge, but was initially more modest, in large part because it had not been supported by the state. The school had gained international exposure since the 1820s, but it was not the only business school open to international students. Its stature and importance ascended during the 19th century and it moved to its current Parisian location on the Avenue de la République in 1898.
