            Hult International Business School (also known as Hult Business School or Hult) is a private business school with campuses in London, San Francisco, Dubai, New York City, and Cambridge, Massachusetts. Hult is named for the school's benefactor Bertil Hult and is affiliated with the EF Education First Group. <br/><br/>Hult is the successor of the Arthur D. Little School of Management, founded in 1964 in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and of the Ashridge Business School, founded in 1959 in Ashridge, England. It offers undergraduate, master's, and MBA degree programs, as well as executive education through Hult Ashridge, housed on the Ashridge Estate campus. The school is also the patron of the Hult Prize, a student entrepreneur competition.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== American background ===<br/><br/>The Arthur D. Little School of Management was founded in 1964 by Arthur Dehon Little in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Originally developed as an executive management education program, the school began to grant degrees after receiving full accreditation by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges in 1976. In 1996, the Arthur D. Little School of Management formed a partnership with Boston College's Carroll School of Management in order to share access to faculty and facilities.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== British background ===<br/><br/><br/><br/>In 1929, Ashridge was formally established as the College of Citizenship with the backing of the Conservative Party. In 1959, the college was re-established as a school of management under the name Ashridge Business School.
