            Melbourne Business School (MBS) is the graduate business school of the University of Melbourne, located in Victoria, Australia.<br/><br/>The School offers a range of programs, including an MBA, specialist Masters programs, a doctoral program, and various executive education programs.<br/><br/>The MBS Head Office and main campus are in the Melbourne suburb of Carlton,<br/><br/>walking distance from Melbourne's Central Business District, in a complex designed by Daryl Jackson.<br/><br/>MBS has an additional office in Pitt Street, Sydney, and a program enquiries office in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>MBS began teaching in 1955 when the University of Melbourne offered Australia's first residential executive education program in the summer of that year. Its first Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree was awarded in 1965, which was also the first MBA degree awarded in Australia.<br/><br/>During the 1980s, MBS was awarded the status of a National Management School by the Australian Government and the Graduate School of Management was established within the University of Melbourne.<br/><br/>In 1989, it was re-organized again, this time as the Graduate School of Management Ltd: a non-profit company limited by guarantee and managed by a board of directors which includes the chairs and directors of leading Australian corporations. This organization structure has helped create a major link between the university and those who have a responsibility for management. It is currently co-owned by the University of Melbourne (45%) and Australian businesses (55%).
