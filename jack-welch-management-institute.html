            The Jack Welch Management Institute (JWMI) at Strayer University is a for-profit online educational institution based in the United States, owned by Strategic Education, Inc. It was founded in 2009 by Jack Welch, former CEO of General Electric and his wife, Suzy Welch, author and public speaker. JWMI offers an online executive Master of Business Administration degree, graduate certificates, and executive certificates for working adults. The company is headquartered outside of Washington D.C. at Strayer University's corporate office - 2303 Dulles Station Blvd, Herndon, VA 20171.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>The Jack Welch Management Institute was sponsored by Chancellor University in 2009, when Welch invested $2 million to purchase a 12% share of the company running the university, Chancellor University Systems. The partnership investment was made possible due to the relationship between Jack Welch and entrepreneur Michael Clifford and allowed the school to emerge from bankruptcy.  Chancellor named the MBA program The Jack Welch Management Institute.<br/><br/>Welch said that he wanted to create a high-quality MBA program that would integrate his philosophy of leadership and human resources into a 12-course program. Welch infused his personal principles into the curriculum.<br/><br/>The institute launched in June 2009, and classes began in January 2010.
