            Bologna Business School (formerly known as Alma Graduate School) is the business school of the University of Bologna.<br/><br/>Today, Alma Graduate School becomes the Foundation of the University of Bologna, with a new name, Bologna Business School, thus reinforcing its international reach, as seen in an increasing number of initiatives in the English language intended for a global audience, such as regular conferences, summer school, short-term courses, fellowships, exchange programmes, and last but not least full professional Master programs. The School was founded in the year 2000 as a consortium between the University of Bologna, Fondazione Carisbo, and the Fondazione Guglielmo Marconi.  In 2006 Alma Graduate School merged with Profingest Management School and is now one of the largest business schools of a public university in Italy.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Location ==<br/><br/>Bologna Business School is located at Villa Guastavillani, a 16th-century residence at the foothills of Bologna. All didactic activities take place within the building (in classrooms, laboratories, study-rooms, common areas, etc.). Villa Guastavillani is approximately ten minutes away from the city center, reachable by car or public transportation.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Accreditations ==<br/><br/>Bologna Business School is accredited by EQUIS – EFMD Quality Improvement System, ASFOR (Associazione Italiana per la Formazione Manageriale), EFMD (European Foundation for Management Development), and - since 2009 – is ranked as a Top Business School Internationally Strong by Eduniversal.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Internationalization ==<br/><br/>In 2011, together with the Chapman Graduate School of Business della Florida International University, Bologna Business School founded the EMBA Consortium for Global Business Innovation.  Today, the network is made of seven international business schools located in Italy, United States of America, Brazil, Russia, China, Turkey, and South Africa: Bologna Business School, University of Bologna; Chapman Graduate School of Business at FIU; COPPEAD Graduate School of Business at UFRJ; MIRBIS Moscow International Higher Business School; School of Economics and Business Administration, Chongqing University; School of Management, Sabanci University, Turkey, and University of Stellenbosch Business School.
