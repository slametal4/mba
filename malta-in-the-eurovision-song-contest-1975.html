            Malta was represented at the Eurovision Song Contest 1975 with the song "Singing This Song", composed by Sammy Galea, with lyrics by M. Iris Misfud, and performed by Renato. The Maltese participating broadcaster, the Maltese Broadcasting Authority (MBA), selected its entry for the contest through a national final.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Before Eurovision ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== National selection ===<br/><br/>Song for Europe 1975 was the national final format developed by the Maltese Broadcasting Authority (MBA) which determined the song that would represent Malta at the Eurovision Song Contest 1975. The competition consisted of two parts. The first part was the Malta Song Festival 1975, where the top 5 songs would then go on to the Song for Europe contest. The two contests were organised by two separate organisations; the Malta Song Festival was organised by the Malta Song Festival Board, while Song for Europe was organised by MBA. The use of Malta Song Festival as part of the Maltese national final was a cooperation between the two organisations, this led to the broadcaster not actually being in control of the songs in its own national final. It was decided to send a song in English for the Eurovision Song Contest 1975 as the MBA believed that the Maltese language was one of the reasons for their last place finishes in 1971 and 1972<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>==== Competing entries ====<br/><br/>The Malta Song Festival Board opened submission period for songs from late November 1974 until 20 December 1974, which was later extended to 28 December 1974. The Malta Song Festival Board shortlisted 12 artists which composers could pick from to perform their songs: Edwin Galea, Mary Rose Mallia, Mary Spiteri, Renato, The Greenfields, Victoria Briffa, John Lucas, Enzo Guzman, Joe Cutajar, Joe Agius, Joe Bugeja, and Bayzo.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>==== Malta Song Festival 1975 ====<br/><br/>Malta Song Festival 1975 was held on 1 February 1975 at the Alhambra Theatre. All songs were sung twice, once in Maltese and then again in English, and the top five qualified to Song for Europe 1975.
