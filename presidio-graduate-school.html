<h1>Presidio Graduate School</h1>
            
            Presidio Graduate School (Presidio) is a private graduate school in San Anselmo, California that was founded in 2002. It offers MBA and MPA degrees in sustainable development. Presidio offers a formal "green MBA" curriculum centered on environmental sustainability and social justice, to a great extent inspired by John Elkington's triple bottom line. In 2015, The New York Times named Presidio the MBA program to choose "if you want to change the world." It was in the process of being acquired by the University of Redlands in Southern California until 2024. The campus moved to San Anselmo (at the site of the San Francisco Theological Seminary, also part of U of R) from San Francisco after the merger was announced. Upon the completion of the merger in summer 2024, the school will be known as the Presidio Center for Sustainable Solutions in the School of Business &amp; Society at the University of Redlands.<br/><br/>Presidio has a low-residency format with face-to-face classes once a month and remaining classes online. About sixty percent of students are women. It was previously known as Presidio World College and as Presidio School of Management. <br/><br/>Presidio is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges.
