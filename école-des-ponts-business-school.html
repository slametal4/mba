The research themes include: Circular Economy, Innovation &amp; Entrepreneurship, Leadership and Talent Management and Digital Transformation &amp; Change Management.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>Established as ENPC School of International Management in 1987 by Celia Russo in 1987 to promote the study of international business and value-based global leadership. It later changed its name to École des Ponts Business School.<br/><br/>Celia Russo, was selected in 1980 by Jacques Tanzi – the then recently appointed Director of Ecole nationale des ponts et chaussées – to set up the Department of Languages and International Culture. Her appointment as a foreigner and as a woman, who was not an engineer, in a wholly French, male-dominated establishment caused an uproar among the school's Board of Governors.  Seven years later, the Board ultimately decided unanimously to implement the business school Celia Russo designed and to support the degree that went with it and to appoint Celia to run it as the Dean. Celia Russo became the first Dean of École des Ponts Business School from 1987 until her death in 1999.
