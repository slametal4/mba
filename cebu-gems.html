            The Cebu Gems, also known as Cebuana Lhuillier Gems, were a professional basketball team in the now-defunct Metropolitan Basketball Association from 1998 to 2002. The team was owned by Jean Henri Lhuillier and played its home games at the Cebu Coliseum.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Cebu Gems (MBA, 1998–2000) ===<br/><br/>The Gems had former national player Leoncio Tan, Jr as their first coach. He was replaced by former PBA player Tonichi Yturri during the inaugural season of the Metropolitan Basketball Association in 1998. Yturri would remain coach of the Cebu Gems until the final MBA season in 2002. Among the players in their first season were Michael Manigo, a 5'7 guard out of Cebu Doctors College, Dondon Hontiveros who won the MBA Discovery of the year award, Rob Wainwright, Rob Duat, Chris Tan, Chris Mendoza, Jan Montalbo, Stephen Padilla and Rudy Enterina. The Gems were able to take the Negros Slashers to a seventh game in the Southern Conference finals.<br/><br/>The following year, the Gems added the likes of Homer Se and Edwin Manabat to the lineup. They lost to Iloilo Megavoltz for the Visayas division title. With the acquisition of Matt Mitchell and Kenny Evans, the Gems made it to the national finals against the Manila Metrostars.
