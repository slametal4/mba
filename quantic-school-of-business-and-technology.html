            Quantic School of Business and Technology is an online private business school based in Washington, D.C. Founded as Smartly Institute by Tom Adams in 2016, the school offers accredited executive degree programs through its proprietary mobile-first learning platform and is known for its unique pedagogy that uses gamified active learning methods.<br/><br/>The school is owned by its parent company Pedago. It currently offers four accredited degree programs, the Master of Business Administration (MBA), the Executive MBA (EMBA), a Master of Science in Business Analytics, and a Master of Science in Software Engineering. The school does not require standardized exams such as GRE or GMAT for admissions.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Active learning ==<br/><br/>Quantic uses an "interactive mobile app" developed by its parent company Pedago. It uses "active learning" methodologies through interactive and gamified learning modules as alternative to video lectures. Successive modules are unlocked after completing tasks such as quizzes from its prerequisite courses. Students are graded numerically and require a passing rate of at least 80% to complete a course. It also has machine-based tutoring that helps provide individualized feedback to students.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Accreditation ==<br/><br/>Quantic received institutional accreditation from the Distance Education Accrediting Commission (DEAC) in 2020.
