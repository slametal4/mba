            The Batangas Blades (or the LBC-Batangas Blades) were a professional basketball team of the now-defunct Metropolitan Basketball Association from 1998 to 2002. <br/><br/>Its moniker was taken from the province's popularity in making Balisong (a Filipino-made knife). It also played for a short time in the Philippine Basketball League after the MBA folded in 2002. <br/><br/>The team played its home games at the De La Salle Lipa SENTRUM from 1998 to 2001 and at the Lipa City Convention Center in 2002. The PBL version of the Blades also played a number of games at both venues. To compensate the loss of the Manila Metrostars after both clubs' merger, the Blades played a few home games in Manila's Mail and More Sports Complex (now San Andres Gym).<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Metropolitan Basketball Association ===<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>==== 1998-2000 ====<br/><br/>In 1998, the Metropolitan Basketball Association was formed as a regional-based professional league which also challenged the commercial Philippine Basketball Association. The Blades were paraded in their first season by former Adamson Falcons players Eddie Laure, Dennis Madrid, former La Salle Green Archer and part-time comedian Maui Roca and Jeff Sanders. The Blades were owned by delivery giant LBC of Santi Araneta.<br/><br/>Laure became the Blades' star player but the team had a disappointing 10-12 win-loss slate despite a late push for the playoffs.
