            Lahore University of Management Sciences, also known by its acronym LUMS, is a private research university in Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan. Founded in 1985, it is ranked as one of the most prestigious modern universities in Pakistan.<br/><br/>In 1984, Syed Babar Ali recognized the shortage of qualified managers in the country. He proposed to establish a world-class university that would attract and retain the highest caliber of students and faculty. He shared this idea with fellow businessman and close friend, Abdul Razak Dawood, who was in full support of the vision. The university has since then expanded, launching a liberal arts undergraduate school in 1994, an engineering school in 2008, a law school in 2004 and an education school in 2017. The university launched a National Outreach Programme (NOP) in 2001 to provide financial aid to students and in 2015, in partnership with Afghan government, launched a scholarship programme for Afghan students to diversify its student body.<br/><br/>As of 2021, the university has a student body of 5,092 graduate and undergraduate students, a faculty of 300 out of which nearly three-quarters have doctoral degrees. Its campus, where more than half of its student population and faculty lives, spreads over 100 acres. Its business school is accredited by Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business.
