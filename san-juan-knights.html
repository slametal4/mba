            The San Juan Knights (SJK, currently competing as the San Juan Kings) are a Filipino professional basketball team based in San Juan. The team competes in the Maharlika Pilipinas Basketball League (MPBL) as a member of the league's North Division. The team plays its home games at Filoil EcoOil Centre.<br/><br/>The team's first incarnation was established in 1999 as a member of the Metropolitan Basketball Association (MBA) and played there until 2001. In 2018, the Knights were revived as they joined the MPBL for the 2018–19 season. The team's second incarnation has taken part in other leagues, including FilBasket, Chooks-to-Go Pilipinas 3x3, and Pilipinas Super League (PSL), the latter of which they compete under the name San Juan Kings. In 2023, their volleyball counterpart, the San Juan Lady Knights became one of the eight charter teams of the Maharlika Pilipinas Volleyball Association (MPVA).<br/><br/>The San Juan-based franchise is one of the most successful region basketball teams in the country. Across both incarnations, the Knights have clinched two championships: one in the MBA (2000) and one in the MPBL (2019). The Knights also made the MPBL's division finals five times in a row from 2019 to 2024, and the MPBL finals in back-to-back seasons (2019 and 2021).
