The school offers undergraduate, master, doctoral, and many executive education programs, with a total enrollment of more than 3,000 students.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Early history ===<br/><br/>The history of Tsinghua SEM dates back to 1926, when Tsinghua University established its Faculty of Economics. In 1956, when the Chinese government decided to regroup higher education institutions in an attempt to build a Soviet-style education system, the Faculty of Economics was separated from Tsinghua and merged into other universities.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Revival ===<br/><br/>In 1979, with the Chinese economic reform taking place, Tsinghua University began setting up a new School of Economics and Management Engineering. The School of Economics and Management was officially established in 1984, with Zhu Rongji serving as the first dean.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Rankings and reputation ==<br/><br/>The Tsinghua School of Economics and Management was founded in 1984 and was the first mainland Chinese institution to have achieved AACSB and EQUIS accreditations for its business and accounting programs. Its founding Dean, Professor Zhu Rongji, later became the fifth Premier of the People's Republic of China. Tsinghua SEM is the successor to Tsinghua University's Department of Economics, which was originally established in 1926.<br/><br/>In 2021, SEM was ranked 11th globally in the Times Higher Education Rankings by Subjects for "Economics and Business" subjects.
