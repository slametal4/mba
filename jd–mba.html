            A JD–MBA is a dual degree program in which students jointly earn Juris Doctor and Master of Business Administration degrees. The programs are commonly offered in the United States and Canada by universities' graduate business and law schools. They allow students to use credits from certain classes in one degree to count for course requirements at the other degree. This allows students to complete both the three-year JD and two-year MBA programs in four years, not the five years the degrees would take if done consecutively.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== By country ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Canada ===<br/><br/>Top-ranking Canadian JD–MBA programs include a four-year JD–MBA at the University of British Columbia, University of Toronto, York University, Queen's University, the three-year JD–MBA at the University of Western Ontario and the three-and-a-half-year JD–MBA at the University of Ottawa. Students may apply to the joint program before matriculating to either program, or after matriculating to either law school or business school.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== United States ===<br/><br/>Many schools in the US offer JD–MBA programs. There are three common lengths of time offered for JD–MBA programs: three-year, three-and-a-half-year, or four-year. All schools listed below with three- or three-and-a-half-year programs also offer a four-year option for the program. Schools listed under the four-year programs only offer a four-year (eight-semester) program.
