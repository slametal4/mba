            Macquarie Business School (MQBS) is a constituent body of Macquarie University, in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.<br/><br/>MQBS is a business school originally established as the Faculty of Business and Economics. The School is the focal point for all business, management, economics research and education at Macquarie University.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History of Macquarie Business School ==<br/><br/>Macquarie Business School began life as the Centre for Management Studies (CMS) within the school of Economic and Financial Studies at North Ryde, Sydney, Australia in 1969. CMS began offering a Graduate Diploma in Business Administration in 1970 and in 1972 it offered a three-year, part-time Master of Business Administration (MBA). In early 1980, CMS developed its own identity as the Graduate School of Management (GMS); it remained within the School of Economic and Financial Studies.<br/><br/>In the mid-1980s the GSM Advisory board recommended GSM should have a separate identity and its own separate dedicated teaching facility. Funds were raised to build the campus from the late 1980s and during the 1990s.<br/><br/><br/><br/>GSM moved to a 40-week teaching term, four-term year in 1989–1990 and this enabled the development of a 16-unit MBA which could be completed in two years' part-time. Master of Arts programmes were developed and later replaced by Master of Management programmes.
