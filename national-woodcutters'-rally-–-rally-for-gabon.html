            The National Woodcutters Rally–Rally for Gabon (French: Rassemblement national des bûcherons–Rassemblement pour le Gabon, RNB–RPG) is a political party in Gabon.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>The party was established in 1990 as Movement for National Rectification–Woodcutters (Mouvement de redressement national–Bûcherons, MORENA–Bûcherons), a breakaway from the Movement for National Rectification. In the 1990 parliamentary elections it won 20 of the 120 seats in the National Assembly, becoming the largest opposition party. In February 1991 it was renamed "National Woodcutters Rally" (RNB).<br/><br/>The RNB nominated Paul Mba Abessole as its candidate for the 1993 presidential elections; He finished second with 26.5% of the vote. Although it won a majority of the contested seats in the 1996 local elections, the party was reduced to seven seats in the 1996 parliamentary elections. However, the following year Mba Abessole was elected mayor of Libreville, where the RNB had a majority on the municipal council.<br/><br/>In 1998 the party split, with a faction led by Pierre-André Kombila leaving to form the National Woodcutters' Rally – Democratic. In the presidential elections later in the year, Mba Abessole finished third with 13% of the vote and Kombila fourth with 1.5%.<br/><br/>In 2000 the party adopted the name "Rally for Gabon", but was referred to as National Woodcutters Rally–Rally for Gabon.
