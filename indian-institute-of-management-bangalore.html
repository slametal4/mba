            Indian Institute of Management Bangalore (IIM Bangalore or IIMB) is a reputed business school and an Institute of National Importance located in Bangalore, Karnataka, India. Founded in 1973, it was chronologically the third in the first generation of IIMs to be established, after IIM Calcutta and IIM Ahmedabad, thereby forming the elite Indian B-School trio colloquially known as 'ABC', or 'IIM A/B/C'.<br/><br/>IIMB was established by the Government of India (GoI) as an institute of excellence for education, training, research, and consulting in the field of management, and allied areas of knowledge. The Indian government called on IIMB to assist and mentor the two newly established IIMs during their inception period - IIM Trichy in 2011, and IIM Visakhapatnam in 2015.<br/><br/>IIMB offers bachelor's, master's, PG diploma, PG certificate fellowship, and doctoral programmes in business administration, business analytics, digital business, entrepreneurship, management, public policy, administration, and corporate governance. The institute also offers Executive Education programmes for corporates, entrepreneurs, government officials, and non-profit organisations. The two-year PGP and one-year EPGP, MBA in general management are the flagship programmes of the institute.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Founding ===<br/><br/>In 1972, a committee headed by Ravi J. Matthai, first director of IIM Ahmedabad and co-founder of IRMA, noting the rising demand for graduates of the first two IIMs (namely, IIMC and IIMA), recommended the need to have two more IIMs. The new IIM was to be set up at Bangalore, and for the proposed institute, the Government of Karnataka offered 105 acres (42 ha) of land (free of cost), and a contribution of INR 3 million (~US$ 390,000 in 1972). Ultimately, on 27 March 1972, the IIMB Society was officially registered in Bangalore under the Mysore Societies' Registration Act.
