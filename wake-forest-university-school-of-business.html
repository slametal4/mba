            The Wake Forest University School of Business is the business school of Wake Forest University, a private research university in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. It offers undergraduate programs to around 1,314 students, as well as management-related masters programs. The school is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges and  the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business, and has supplemental accounting accreditation by the latter agency. It has a second campus in Charlotte, North Carolina.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>The School of Business Administration, first established in 1948, was named the Charles H. Babcock School of Business Administration in 1969, admitting its first classes of full-time and executive students in 1971 and presenting its first graduating class in 1973. In 1972, the school enrolled only graduate students and the name was changed to the Babcock Graduate School of Management. The Babcock School, which earned its accreditation from the AACSB in 1985, was established with a gift from the Mary Reynolds Babcock Foundation and named in honor of Charles H. Babcock, a businessman and philanthropist who influenced civic, cultural, and economic development in Winston-Salem and North Carolina.<br/><br/>In 1980, the Department of Business and Accountancy was reconstituted as the School of Business and Accountancy; the name was changed to the Wayne Calloway School of Business and Accountancy in 1995. In 1993, the school moved into the newly constructed Worrell Professional Center, the first building in the nation to house both graduate business and law schools under one roof. The Calloway and Babcock schools were integrated as the Wake Forest University School of Business in 2009, combining the faculties of the business schools to serve undergraduate and graduate students.
