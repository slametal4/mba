            Birmingham Business School (BBS) is the business school of the University of Birmingham in England. Established in 1989, the school traces its history back to the School of Commerce founded in 1902, leading to it sometimes being identified as the oldest business school in the United Kingdom. Edgar Meyer was announced new dean in June 2023.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>In 1901, Sir William Ashley took the first Chair of Commerce at the school, where he fostered the development of its commercial programme. From 1902 until 1923 he served as the first Professor of Commerce and dean of the faculty, which he was instrumental in founding. <br/><br/>Ashley said that the aim of the new faculty was the education not of the "rank and file, but of the officers of the industrial and commercial army: of those who, as principals, directors, managers, secretaries, heads of department, etc., will ultimately guide the business activity of the country".<br/><br/>In its first year, the annual costs of the faculty, including staff salaries, were £8,200. There were six students, a lecture room and two classrooms. By 1908, fifteen men had graduated from the school.<br/><br/>However, the teaching of the time was not grounded in academic research and lacked a theoretical basis, damaging the reputation of Birmingham and other schools of commerce.
