            The Neeley School of Business is the undergraduate and graduate business school at Texas Christian University (TCU), a private university located in Fort Worth, Texas.

The Department of Business Administration was established in 1922, and became the School of Business in 1938, the first year to offer a master of business administration. Student organizations included the TCU Chamber of Commerce, begun in 1939, and the Collegiate Business and Professional Women's Club. E. M. Sowell was appointed the first dean in 1944. In 1967, the School of Business was named for M.J. Neeley in honor of his personal service of 25 years on the TCU Board of Trustees and financial contributions to TCU. Applications have risen steadily in recent years. The Neeley School of Business currently makes up one-third of the TCU student population.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Campus ==<br/><br/>TCU is located in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex, the "Fourth Best Metropolitan Area for Business," according to Forbes magazine. Metroplex corporations participate in Neeley School mentorships, internships, special projects, and hiring. The Metroplex is home to DFW International Airport.
