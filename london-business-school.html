            London Business School (LBS) is a business school and a constituent college of the federal University of London. LBS was founded in 1964 and awards post-graduate degrees (Master's degrees in management and finance, MBA and PhD). Its motto is "To have a profound impact on the way the world does business".<br/><br/>The main campus is located at Sussex Place in London, adjacent to Regent's Park. In 2012, the school acquired the Marylebone Town Hall and spent £60 million to refurbish it with the objective of expanding its teaching facilities by 70% - the new building is called The Sammy Ofer Centre. In 2017, it was announced that LBS had also acquired the site of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, who vacated the building in November 2019.<br/><br/>LBS has a secondary campus in Dubai that is dedicated to Executive Education and the Dubai EMBA.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Foundation ===<br/><br/><br/><br/>London Business School was founded in 1964 under the name of the 'London Graduate School of Business Studies', with Dr. Arthur Earle as Dean.
