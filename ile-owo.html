            Ile Owo is a 2022 Nigerian psychological thriller film written and directed by Dare Olaitan, and features Immaculate Oko Kasum, Tina Mba, Efa Iwara, and Mofe Duncan. It tells the story of a family entwined in a centuries-old pact - the sacrifice of a young virgin to preserve immortality. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Synopsis ==<br/><br/>Busola (Immaculate Oko Kasum) - a young nurse with an invalid father and a commitment-phobic fiancé - discovers a deity outside on her way to work which mysteriously disappears when she summons her deeply spiritual mother (Tina Mba). The latter senses unfamiliarity around the house, and hands her daughter blessed olive oil which she promises to take with her everywhere. After she breaks up with her boyfriend Lanre, Busola is left frustrated, particularly after a subsequent date goes awry, until she tends to Tunji (Efa Iwara), a wealthy patient who takes a shine to her. Bisola, whose pastor had recently prophesied that she would soon marry a suitable man that year, sees his advances as a sign, but her mother does not approve although her father takes his daughter's side. <br/><br/>With the help of her friend Jola (Bukunmi Adeaga-Ilori), Busola - who is preparing for a dinner date - receives a makeover, wearing the jewellery Tunji had gifted her as part of her ensemble. At dinner aboard his yacht, Bisola experiences strange events linked to her necklace. Sensing danger, her mother tries to protect her daughter through prayers, but her husband, prompted by evil spirits, halts her session by knocking her unconscious. She is rushed to hospital, and Tunji offers to accommodate both Busola and her father while she recovers.
