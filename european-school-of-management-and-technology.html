            The European School of Management and Technology, also known as ESMT Berlin, is a private non-profit business school based in Berlin, Germany. The business school was founded in 2002 by 25 companies and institutions and offers a range of MBAs, master's degrees, and other degree and executive education programs.<br/><br/>The owner of the business school is the ESMT European School of Management and Technology GmbH (ESMT GmbH), which is recognized as a non-profit organization. ESMT Berlin is regarded as one of the most prestigious business schools in Europe. It is one of four business schools in Germany with triple accreditation from EQUIS, AACSB, and AMBA.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>ESMT Berlin was founded on October 31, 2002, by 25 multinational corporations seeking to break from the traditional approaches of German executive education by creating a more international business school in Germany.<br/><br/>The founding companies invested approximately 65 million euros into the ESMT foundation, which owns the school. In October 2003, ESMT Berlin was granted permission from the Senate of Berlin to operate as a private university. Initially, programs were held in Munich, while the ESMT campus in Berlin was under construction until 2006.<br/><br/>In December 2006, the first students at the business school received their degrees. Following financial problems, a further 60 million euros was invested in ESMT Berlin's endowment fund in 2010.
