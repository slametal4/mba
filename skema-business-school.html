            SKEMA Business School ("School of Knowledge Economy and Management") is a leading French business school with campuses across Europe, the Americas, Asia, and Africa. It was established in 2009 through the merger of Ecole Supérieure de Commerce de Lille (ESC Lille) and CERAM Business School in Sophia Antipolis.<br/><br/>The school holds international accreditations from EQUIS and AACSB, and its Executive MBA is accredited by the EFMD (EFMD Accredited EMBA). SKEMA was ranked 26th in the 2024 Financial Times European Business Schools ranking and is listed among the top business schools in the QS Business Masters Rankings. <br/><br/>Among its postgraduate offerings, the Master in Financial Markets &amp; Investments (FMI) is oriented toward careers in investment banking, asset management, and risk analysis. In the 2024 Financial Times Masters in Finance Pre-experience ranking, the program was ranked 3rd worldwide.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>The merger was announced on 30 June 2009, and they now form a single non-profit organization confirmed by their respective governing bodies (the General Assembly of the French Riviera Chamber of Commerce and the Board of Directors of ESC Lille). In spite of some criticism due to the heterogeneity level regarding student selection, the official ceremony and announcement of the new name took place on 16 November 2009. CERAM Business School and ESC Lille were respectively founded in 1963 by the French Riviera Chamber of Commerce and in 1892 by Lille Chamber of Commerce.<br/><br/>The new school name, SKEMA, is derived from the Greek, skhêma (shape, figure, formation of an object) meaning schema in Latin.
