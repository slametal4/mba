            The Amos Tuck School of Business Administration at Dartmouth College is the graduate business school of Dartmouth College, a private Ivy League research university in Hanover, New Hampshire. The school offers only a Master of Business Administration degree program.<br/><br/>Founded in 1900, the Tuck School was the first institution in the world to offer a master's degree in business administration, and is the second oldest Ivy League business school.<br/><br/>The Tuck School awards only one degree, the Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree, through a full-time, residential program. Tuck is known for its rural setting and small class size — each MBA class consists of about 280 students. As such, both factors, combined with Tuck's commitment to the full-time MBA program, contribute to its high giving rate among the 10,300 Tuck alumni across 73 countries. Almost 70% of all Tuck alumni regularly give to the school, the highest rate among business schools worldwide.<br/><br/>Graduates of the Tuck School of Business earn some of the highest salaries of MBA programs in the United States. MBA graduates of Tuck earned an average $170,000 first year compensation, not including performance-based bonuses or equity-based compensation, the third highest of all US-based MBA programs. Tuck's MBA program ties for 9th place with MIT for the highest average GMAT score of 722 for its entering class.
