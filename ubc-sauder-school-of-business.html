            The UBC Sauder School of Business is the business school of the University of British Columbia. The faculty is located in Vancouver on UBC's Point Grey campus and has a secondary teaching facility at UBC Robson Square downtown. UBC Sauder has been accredited by AACSB since 2003. The current Dean is Darren Dahl (since 2022).<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>First established in 1956, the UBC Faculty of Commerce and Business Administration was renamed UBC Sauder School of Business in 2003, in recognition of a donation of a $20 million endowment by William Sauder.<br/><br/>Following a donation from Vancouver business philanthropist Robert H. Lee, the Robert H. Lee Graduate School was established at UBC Sauder in 2006 to support graduate-level education.<br/><br/>In 2012, the UBC Sauder School of Business completed a major renovation to its Henry Angus Building on the UBC campus, adding 55,000 square feet to the original 216,000 square-foot building. The renovation was designed by Acton Ostry Architects and added the Cannacord Learning Commons, Wayne Dean Investment Analysis Centre, and the Bruce Birmingham Undergraduate Centre along with new classrooms and a conference center.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Programs ==<br/><br/>The UBC Sauder School of Business offers the following programs:<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Graduate Programs (Robert H. Lee Graduate School) ===<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>==== Masters of Business Administration (MBA) ====<br/><br/>Students in UBC Sauder's MBA program choose between one of four career tracks (Technology and analytics leadership; Finance; Product and service management; and, Innovation and entrepreneurship), or build a custom career track. The program culminates with a three-day live-case competition, where students present solutions to real business problems to CEOs and business leaders.
