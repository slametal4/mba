            The Robert J. Trulaske Sr. College of Business, more commonly known as the Trulaske College of Business, is the second largest academic division at the University of Missouri in Columbia, Missouri.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>The College of Business was established as a senior professional school on January 19, 1914 as the School of Commerce. The first faculty was appointed on February 18, 1914 with professor Herbert J. Davenport as the first dean. The College of Business's prestigious donor organization was named The Herbert J. Davenport Society to pay tribute to the first dean. The name of the school was changed to the School of Commerce and Public Administration on May 31, 1916, and later that year, Dean Davenport resigned to accept a professorship in economics at Cornell University.  The name of the school was changed again on January 23, 1917 to the School of Business and Public Administration.<br/><br/>With a wide course offering, students may enroll in a number of classes that they find applicable. Notably, Management 4970 is a required course that every major must enroll in.<br/><br/>During the early stages of the college, there was some controversy regarding the nature of the courses that would be offered.
