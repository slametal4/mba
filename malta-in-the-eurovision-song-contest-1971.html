            Malta was represented at the Eurovision Song Contest 1971 with the song "Marija l-Maltija", composed by Joe Grech, with lyrics by Charles Mifsud, and performed by Grech himself. The Maltese participating broadcaster, the Maltese Broadcasting Authority (MBA), selected its entry through a national final. This was the first-ever entry from Malta in the Eurovision Song Contest, and the first-ever entry performed in Maltese in the contest.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Before Eurovision ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== National selection ===<br/><br/>Song for Europe was the national final format developed by the Maltese Broadcasting Authority (MBA) which determined the song that would represent Malta at the Eurovision Song Contest 1971. The competition consisted of two parts. The first part was the Malta Song Festival 1970, where the top 6 songs would then go on to the Song For Europe contest. The two contests were organised by two separate organisations; the Malta Song Festival was organised by the Malta Song Festival Board, while Song For Europe was organised by MBA. The use of Malta Song Festival as part of the Maltese national final was a cooperation between the two organisations, this led to the broadcaster not actually being in control of the songs in its own national final.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>==== Competing entries ====<br/><br/>The Malta Song Festival Board received 60 submissions, from which 12 were chosen to compete in the Malta Song Festival.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>==== Malta Song Festival 1970 ====<br/><br/>Malta Song Festival 1970 was held on 28 November 1970 at the Malta Hilton. All songs were sung twice, and the top six qualified to Song For Europe 1971.
