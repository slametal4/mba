            The Purdue University Daniels School of Business (formerly known as Krannert School of Management) is the school of business at Purdue University, a public research university in West Lafayette, Indiana. It offers instruction at the undergraduate, master's, and doctoral levels.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>The School of Industrial Management at Purdue University was created in 1958 from the merger of the Department of Economics (established in the School of Science, Education, and Humanities in 1953) and the Department of Industrial Management and Transportation (part of the Schools of Engineering since 1956). The Krannert Graduate School of Industrial Administration was founded in 1962 with a $2.7 million endowment from Herman Krannert and Ellnora Krannert. The AACSB accredited the new school in 1967. In the early years, students were required to pursue a second major, in a technical subject, in addition to their coursework in business and management. The curriculum expanded over the following decade and the word "Industrial" was dropped from the schools' names in the mid 1970s.<br/><br/>On February 3, 2023, Purdue’s business school was formally named the Mitch Daniels School of Business, in honor of Mitch Daniels, who served as the 12th president of Purdue University from January 2013 to the last day of 2022.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Academics ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>Purdue's business school is accredited by the AACSB.<br/><br/>The Mitch Daniels School of Business differentiates itself from similarly sized business programs by providing an emphasis on a STEM-focused, data-driven education. All degrees awarded are Bachelors of Science.
