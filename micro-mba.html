<h1>Micro-MBA</h1>
            
            The Micro-MBA is a learner-driven, outcomes-based entrepreneurial course based on classroom session followed by pro-active mentoring meetings. The programme aims to teach entrepreneurs, mostly in developing countries, fundamental business skills so that they can operate their businesses successfully. The term Micro-MBA refers to “Managing Business Activities” at the micro and small-business levels. The course programme focuses on teaching practical skillsabout subjects such as money management, stock control, customer handling, and marketing that can be applied in the daily business activities of the business owners. The initial 5-day classroom experience is followed by 3 months of required mentoring. At that stage, learners who have demonstrated their application of what they learned, are awarded diplomas under the authority of Trident Institute.<br/><br/>The Micro-MBA is offered by independent community-based trainers, as well as trainers working with training companies, universities, NGOs, NPOs, CBOs and religious organisations. Trainers courses are offered regularly on the Zoom platform. While the Micro-MBA is not formally accredited, it meets all the requirements of Unit Standard 14444 at NQF Level 1 (7 credits).<br/><br/>The new MICRO-MBA MOBILE and BIZ-CALC Apps (for Android), make distance-learning possible.
