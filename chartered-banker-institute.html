            The Chartered Banker Institute was established in 1875 and is the oldest professional banking institute in the world and the only remaining banking institute in the UK. It aims to help rebuild public confidence in banks and bankers by developing and embedding high ethical, professional and technical standards. The institute offers a range of qualifications for banking and financial services.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>The organisation was formed in 1875 as the Institute of Bankers in Scotland. In 1976, a first royal charter was awarded and it became the Chartered Institute of Bankers in Scotland.<br/><br/>In 2011, the Institute led the establishment of the Chartered Banker Professional Standards Board (CB:PSB) an initiative supported by eight UK banks and covering 350,000 individuals working in the banking sector. The CB:PSB develops and supports the implementation of industry-wide professional standards which set out the knowledge, skills, attitudes and behaviours expected of all UK bankers.<br/><br/>Based at Drumsheugh House in Edinburgh, the institute has more than 30,000 members in 59 countries. As of 2020 there were around one thousand fellows, who may use the post-nominals FCBI.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Qualifications ==<br/><br/>The Chartered Banker Institute provides a wide range of qualifications for banking and financial services. It is responsible for awarding Chartered Banker designation to qualified bankers, a protected title. As a professional body it is authorised by the UK Privy Council to award this designation.
