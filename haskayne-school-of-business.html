            The Haskayne School of Business is the University of Calgary's business school, located in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. It is named after Richard F. Haskayne, who gave one of the largest endowments to a business school in Canada. The school offers undergraduate, masters, and PhD degrees, as well as executive education programs. Haskayne is ranked as one of the top business schools in Canada and one of the top 100 in the world.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>Founded as the Faculty of Business in 1967 and renamed Faculty of Management in 1978, the school was later renamed in honour of Richard F. Haskayne in 2002. In 1986, the faculty moved into the newly constructed Scurfield Hall, which was the result of donations made by Ralph Scurfield, his family, and Nu-West Group of Companies. The new building cost $16 million. In 1991, an additional floor was added to the building at a cost of $3.3 million.<br/><br/>In 2002, Richard (Dick) Haskayne, a University of Alberta graduate, made a $16 million contribution to the school. The school was named in his honour.
