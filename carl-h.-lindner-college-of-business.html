On June 21, 2011, the college was named after Carl Henry Lindner, Jr. in honor of the contributions he has made to the university, college, and the business community.

In 1912, the University of Cincinnati Board of Trustees took over the college. In 1919, the College of Commerce was merged with the College of Engineering to form the College of Engineering Commerce. In 1946, the college resumed operation as a separate entity.
