            The Yale School of Management (also known as Yale SOM) is the graduate business school of Yale University, a private research university in New Haven, Connecticut. The school awards the Master of Business Administration (MBA), MBA for Executives (EMBA), Master of Advanced Management (MAM), Master's Degree in Systemic Risk (SR), Master's Degree in Global Business &amp; Society (GBS), Master's Degree in Asset Management (AM), and Ph.D. degrees, as well as joint degrees with nine other graduate programs at Yale University. The Yale School of Management is one of six Ivy League Business Schools.<br/><br/>The school conducts education and research in leadership, behavioral economics, operations management, marketing, entrepreneurship, organizational behavior, and other areas. The EMBA program offers focused study in healthcare, asset management, or sustainability. <br/><br/>The school also offers semester-long student exchange programs with HEC Paris, IESE, the London School of Economics, the National University of Singapore Business School, and Tsinghua University. Students may also propose a quarter- or semester-long exchange program with any of the 25 other schools of the Global Network for Advanced Management.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>Beginning in the 1950s, Yale University started to expand coursework offerings in business and organization management. A precursor to the School of Management, the Department of Industrial Administration, grew out of the Labor and Management Center, and conferred the master in industrial administration from 1958 through 1973. Professors Thomas Holmes, Chris Argyris, and David Votaw were instrumental in founding the MIA. In 1971, Yale University received a donation establishing a program in management from Frederick W. Beinecke, PhB 1909.
